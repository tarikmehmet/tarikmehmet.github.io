<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Amanda C. Pustilnik<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark6">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Is there such a thing as a criminally “violent brain”? Does it make sense to speak of “the neurobiology of violence” or the&nbsp;“psychopathology of crime”? Is it possible to answer on a&nbsp;physiological level what makes one person engage in criminal&nbsp;violence and another not, under similar circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Current research in law and neuroscience is promising to answer these questions with a “yes.” Some legal scholars&nbsp;working in this area claim that we are close to realizing the&nbsp;“early criminologists’ dream of identifying the biological roots&nbsp;of criminality.” These hopes for a neuroscientific&nbsp;transformation of the criminal law, although based in the&nbsp;newest research, are part of a very old story. Criminal law and&nbsp;neuroscience have been engaged in an ill-fated and sometimes&nbsp;tragic affair for over two hundred years. Three issues have&nbsp;recurred that track those that bedeviled earlier efforts to ground&nbsp;criminal law in brain sciences. First is the claim that the brain&nbsp;is often the most relevant or fundamental level at which to&nbsp;understand criminal conduct. Second is that the various&nbsp;phenomena we call “criminal violence” arise causally from&nbsp;dysfunction within specific locations in the brain&nbsp;(“localization”). Third is the related claim that, because much&nbsp;violent criminality arises from brain dysfunction, people who&nbsp;commit such acts are biologically different from typical people&nbsp;(“alterity” or “otherizing”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Article first demonstrates parallels between certain current claims about the neurobiology of criminal violence and&nbsp;past movements that were concerned with the law and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">neuroscience of violence: phrenology, Lombrosian biological criminology, and lobotomy. It then engages in a substantive&nbsp;review and critique of several current claims about the&nbsp;neurological bases of criminal violence. Drawing on research&nbsp;and interviews with neuroscientists, this Article shows that&nbsp;causally localizing what we call “criminal violence” to bits of&nbsp;the brain is scientifically contestable and epistemologically&nbsp;untenable. In viewing the criminal law-neuro science&nbsp;relationship through the lens of history of science, this Article&nbsp;hopes to offer a constructive portrait of how current&nbsp;neuroscience might inform criminal law discourse about&nbsp;regulating violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="font4">Is there such a thing as a criminally “violent brain”? Does it make sense to speak of “the neurobiology of violence”<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark7">2</a></sup><sup></sup> or the&nbsp;“psychopathology of crime”?<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark8">3</a></sup><sup></sup> Is it possible to answer on a&nbsp;physiological level what makes one person engage in criminal&nbsp;violence and another not, under similar circumstances?</p>
<p class="font4">Current research in law and neuroscience is promising to answer these questions—and to answer each of them with a “yes.”&nbsp;Several scholars working in this area claim that we are “close [ ] to&nbsp;realizing the early criminologists’ dream of identifying the biological&nbsp;roots of criminality.”<a name="footnote4"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark9">4</a></sup><sup></sup> They urge not that some criminals suffer from&nbsp;mental diseases but that “crime [is] a disease”<a name="footnote5"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark10">5</a></sup><sup></sup> that the criminal law&nbsp;should, across the board, “adopt a disease theory view of crime.<a name="footnote6"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark11">6</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>This “disease” of violent crime does not arise from metaphorically&nbsp;“sick” personal choices or social conditions; rather, some claim that&nbsp;neuroscientists have discovered in criminal offenders a ‘“biological&nbsp;brain-proneness’ toward violence” that substantially explains the&nbsp;existence of violent crime.<a name="footnote7"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark12">7</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">The current, hopeful claims about the discovery of biological roots of criminality are part of a very old story. Criminal law and&nbsp;neuroscience<a name="footnote8"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark13">8</a></sup><sup></sup> have been engaged in an episodic and ill-fated love&nbsp;affair for over two hundred years. In each era, it starts with bold&nbsp;promises and a belief in the genuine mutual compatibility of the two&nbsp;fields, but ends in disappointment and even tragedy. With every&nbsp;resurgence in this mutual infatuation, lawmakers and scientists&nbsp;swear that they will not make the same mistakes this time—&nbsp;principally because this time, science has finally matured.</p>
<p class="font4">The fraught relationship between criminal law and neuroscience is worth re-examining now, in light of its history,&nbsp;because we are at a moment of renewed infatuation. Indeed, we are&nbsp;at the threshold of what some claim is no less than a neuroscientific&nbsp;revolution within law that promises biologically-based explanations&nbsp;of general features of human conduct.<a name="footnote9"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark14">9</a></sup><sup></sup> This new movement carries&nbsp;forward some of the suspect epistemology of the prior movements—&nbsp;but it also contains more real potential. A careful understanding of&nbsp;the epistemic traps of the past and their relationship to certain&nbsp;current ways of framing the brain-criminal law relationship will&nbsp;help integrate neuroscience with law in ways that can enhance&nbsp;specific doctrines within criminal law and evidence, although in a&nbsp;more bounded fashion than some of the movement’s strongest&nbsp;proponents might claim.</p>
<p class="font4">Neuroscience evidence and principles have already begun to find their way into criminal adjudications<a name="footnote10"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark15">10</a></sup><sup></sup> and criminal law&nbsp;scholarship.<a name="footnote11"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark16">11</a></sup><sup></sup> This explosion of interest in neuroscience to&nbsp;illuminate the (presumably universal) workings of the human mind&nbsp;has spawned a host of neuro-fields—from neuroethics,<a name="footnote12"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">12</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>neuroeconomics,<a name="footnote13"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark18">13</a></sup><sup></sup> and neurohistory,<a name="footnote14"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark19">14</a></sup><sup></sup> to neurolaw<a name="footnote15"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark20">15</a></sup><sup></sup> and&nbsp;neurojurisprudence.<a name="footnote16"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark21">16</a></sup><sup></sup> Contributions to law from these emerging,&nbsp;hybrid fields may be substantial. Neuroeconomics, in concert with&nbsp;behavioral economics, is constructing more realistic and robust&nbsp;models of individual, group, and market behavior, with potentially&nbsp;profound implications for the design of legal institutions.<a name="footnote17"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark22">17</a></sup><sup></sup> The&nbsp;neuroimaging of pain may influence legal doctrines from tort and&nbsp;disability to the death penalty and torture.<a name="footnote18"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark23">18</a></sup><sup></sup> And work on the&nbsp;relationship between emotion and decision making may cause legal&nbsp;scholars and philosophers to re-examine the relative importance of,&nbsp;and relationships between, emotional and reason-based methods of&nbsp;decision making.<a name="footnote19"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark24">19</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Moving far beyond that, however, some important voices make more imperialistic claims, arguing that we will be able to craft social&nbsp;regimes built on “universal morals possessed by all members of our&nbsp;species ... a brain-based philosophy of life.”<a name="footnote20"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark25">20</a></sup><sup></sup> It is the contention of&nbsp;this Article that overreaching claims about the relationship between&nbsp;individual neurobiology and criminal violence can undo the&nbsp;productive contributions that neuroscience could otherwise make to&nbsp;the criminal law. Because such claims exceed what the data show,&nbsp;early legal adopters of more extreme forms of “neurolaw” could&nbsp;create a backlash against neuroscience findings. Perhaps most&nbsp;importantly, overreaching claims about the applicability of&nbsp;neuroscience may lead to misapplications similar to those of prior&nbsp;episodes of the criminal law-neuroscience story.</p>
<p class="font4">The central tenets of some current work on the criminal law and neuroscience of violence are similar to those that underlay, and&nbsp;ultimately undermined, past movements. This Article will argue&nbsp;that these tenets, and the problems inherent in them, are:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font4">• Because all behavior emerges from the brain, the individual</p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">brain, in isolation, is the most relevant site for understanding criminal behavior (this presents the problem&nbsp;of levels of explanation);</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font4">• Because the brain is composed of specialized regions, criminal</p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">behaviors like unlawful violence of all kinds must arise from particular brain regions (this presents the compound&nbsp;problem of reification and localization); and</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font4">• Because some people who commit violent crimes have brain</p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">disorders, lawbreaking is best understood as the result of disease or as a disease in itself (this is the problem of alterity&nbsp;or “otherizing”).</p>
<p class="font4">In viewing the criminal law-neuroscience relationship through the lens of history of science, this Article hopes to offer both caveats and&nbsp;a constructive portrait of how neuroscience might inform criminal&nbsp;law discourse on regulating violence without recapitulating these&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p class="font4">Part I of this Article, A History of Violence, examines three movements in law and brain science that prefigure and inform&nbsp;current efforts: phrenological studies of criminal behavior in the late&nbsp;eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Cesare Lombroso’s&nbsp;“scientific” criminology in the late nineteenth and early twentieth&nbsp;centuries, and psychointervention (lobotomy and electrode&nbsp;implantation) arising against the backdrop of social turmoil of the&nbsp;mid-twentieth century. In each of these subsections, I will show&nbsp;how these disparate (although equally ill-fated) attempts to solve&nbsp;the problem of violent crime through then-current brain sciences&nbsp;evolved similarly: each started out with a precommitment to the&nbsp;idea of the brain localization of violence, often based on studies&nbsp;either of extreme human pathology or studies of animals with&nbsp;substantially different evolutionary histories than humans. The&nbsp;scientific and medical proponents of each had an express interest in&nbsp;the social implications of their work and sought to reform or revise&nbsp;criminal law through their work. And, legal scholars and criminal&nbsp;law actors embraced and put into practice regimes based on the&nbsp;work before an ultimate backlash shut them down.</p>
<p class="font4">The tragic shortcomings of the work of earlier eras now are dismissed as unfortunate historical curiosities.<a name="footnote21"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark26">21</a></sup><sup></sup> This Part will&nbsp;contend, however, that past efforts to invent a scientific criminal law&nbsp;based on brain science foundered on many of the same shoals that&nbsp;could undermine current neurolaw efforts; the history of these&nbsp;failures thus provides a highly relevant set of lessons.</p>
<p class="font4">Moving from historical to current efforts to ground criminal law in brain science, Part II describes examples of current scholarship&nbsp;on the neurobiology of violence. It presents arguments of influential&nbsp;scholars that there is a deterministic relationship between violent&nbsp;behavior and what they identify as brain dysfunction. Such scholars&nbsp;embrace the view that the “mechanistically determined” brain&nbsp;contains “the essential ingredients of the human condition.”<a name="footnote22"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark27">22</a></sup><sup></sup> This&nbsp;Part also will examine causal claims made from neuroimaging&nbsp;studies through examining an exemplary study on brain differences&nbsp;between pedophiles and typical adults. Because scholarship&nbsp;described in this Part emphasizes the biology of individual brains&nbsp;above other modes of explaining criminality, it emerges from the&nbsp;tradition of reductionism in Western scientific and philosophical&nbsp;thought. A full-scale critique of reductive individualism in legal&nbsp;uses of brain sciences is beyond the scope of this Article. However,&nbsp;this Part will set up the Article’s consideration of the “practical,&nbsp;technical, and epistemic concerns”<a name="footnote23"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark28">23</a></sup><sup></sup> posed by such brain-based&nbsp;reductionism in criminal law.</p>
<p class="font4">Part III shows the formidable, perhaps insurmountable, technical and epistemic hurdles to a purely, or primarily, brainbased view of violent crime. Critiquing current claims within legal&nbsp;scholarship about the neurobiology of violence, it demonstrates the&nbsp;major barriers to the causal localizability of violence to specific parts&nbsp;of the brain (particularly, the prefrontal cortex<a name="footnote24"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark29">24</a></sup><sup></sup> and the&nbsp;amygdala<a name="footnote25"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark30">25</a></sup><sup></sup>). This Part looks first at the state of knowledge in&nbsp;neuroscience about the localizability of brain function generally,&nbsp;starting with sensory-motor localization. It then presents the major&nbsp;challenges that other neuroscientists have raised in relation to&nbsp;attempts to localize higher cognitive functions and behaviors, like&nbsp;“violence.” Finally, it considers an in-principle barrier to reducing&nbsp;violence entirely to brain operations: the role of law in defining what&nbsp;is or is not “violence.” Given that the law can and does change what&nbsp;is encompassed within the category of violence, unlawful violent&nbsp;behavior must be understood at least in part as arising relationally&nbsp;between people and the law, rather than entirely internally to the&nbsp;brain.</p>
<p class="font4">The final Part draws out the conceptual and epistemological commonalities among current and historical criminal law efforts to&nbsp;understand violence neurobiologically. It will argue that past and&nbsp;current efforts to develop a purely brain-based understanding of&nbsp;violence in criminal law manifest certain epistemological problems.&nbsp;While contemporary researchers now use sophisticated techniques&nbsp;to image or stimulate parts of the brain, today’s claims that a&nbsp;general cause of violence is overactivity or hypometabolism in&nbsp;certain brain regions are not conceptually distinct from lobotomists’&nbsp;claims that violence could be cured through cutting out the violent&nbsp;part of the brain<a name="footnote26"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark31">26</a></sup><sup></sup> or phrenologists’ assertion that there is a “murder&nbsp;bump.”</p>
<p class="font4">Moving to the potential uses of neuroscience in the criminal law, Part IV will contrast the legal applications of neuroscience that&nbsp;would emerge from the view that violent conduct is the expression of&nbsp;brain dysfunction versus those that would emerge from a view that&nbsp;the brain is an important, but not exclusive, level of explanation for&nbsp;different types of violent crimes. The former approach is strongly&nbsp;individualistic; its prescriptions would focus on finding and treating&nbsp;some disorder within the offender’s brain. The second approach&nbsp;would also account for medical pathology, if any. But, in viewing&nbsp;the brain as a contributor to and a product of the social world, and&nbsp;in viewing violence as a set of behaviors that are not <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">per se&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">pathological, this approach points toward using neuroscience as one&nbsp;tool to help understand an array of issues of relevance to the&nbsp;criminal law, including—among other issues—how people make&nbsp;decisions about obeying or breaking the law; what conditions&nbsp;provoke violence in typical as well as atypical people; and the&nbsp;general conditions (such as minimum early childhood needs) for&nbsp;developing healthy, well-functioning minds.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font4">I. A <span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">History of Violence (in Criminal Jurisprudence)</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">The criminal law takes as its object the definition, deterrence, and punishment of proscribed violent behavior; indeed, the&nbsp;regulation of interpersonal violence (and the arrogation to the state&nbsp;of the prerogative to inflict violence) arguably is a primary focus of&nbsp;criminal lawmaking and theory.<a name="footnote27"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark32">27</a></sup><sup></sup> So explanations of the causes of—&nbsp;and potential ways to identify and address people prone to—violence&nbsp;are, at least in theory, of great criminal law significance.&nbsp;Accordingly, theories of the causes of violence and of ways to identify&nbsp;and deal with people who may be prone to violence historically have&nbsp;exerted tremendous pull over many criminal law scholars and&nbsp;practitioners. “We are placing the question of violence right in the&nbsp;middle of our basic research on the neurobiology of emotion,” says&nbsp;clinical psychologist Richard Davidson.<a name="footnote28"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark33">28</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">This Part looks at several examples of historical efforts to tackle violence scientifically within law: phrenological studies of criminal&nbsp;behavior in the early nineteenth century, Cesare Lombroso’s&nbsp;“scientific” criminology in the late nineteenth and early twentieth&nbsp;centuries, and psychosurgery and subsequent, related efforts on the&nbsp;neurobiological control of violence arising in part out of midtwentieth century United States race riots. This history of these&nbsp;failed scientific approaches to violence in the criminal law highlights&nbsp;general methodological and epistemological traps; it thus provides a&nbsp;highly relevant and instructive set of lessons. The sometimes&nbsp;uncanny similarities between past and current efforts also provide a&nbsp;useful counterbalance to the current untempered enthusiasm for&nbsp;“neurolaw” solutions to problems of violence.</p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. The Original Scientific Criminologies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1. Phrenology: You Should Have Your Head Examined<a name="footnote29"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark34">29</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">Phrenology was the nineteenth century’s science of the mind. Scientists and doctors who practiced phrenology, starting with the&nbsp;Austrian anatomist Franz Josef Gall, contended that a person’s&nbsp;character could be determined from the bumps and hollows on the&nbsp;outside of the skull.<a name="footnote30"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark35">30</a></sup><sup></sup> From the beginning, Gall’s work intersected&nbsp;with the criminal law, as he principally developed his observations&nbsp;and theories through examining the heads of criminals and those&nbsp;confined for insanity.<a name="footnote31"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark36">31</a></sup><sup></sup> Specific bumps and depressions were said to&nbsp;correspond to qualities like “wit,” “joking,” and “poetic ability.”<a name="footnote32"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark37">32</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Others corresponded more closely to the study of violent crime: an&nbsp;“instinct to kill,”<a name="footnote33"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark38">33</a></sup><sup></sup> “combativeness,” and “destructiveness.”<a name="footnote34"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark39">34</a></sup><sup></sup> All was&nbsp;not lost, though, if your skull revealed you to be, for example,&nbsp;hopelessly humorless (or murderous): you could increase the size of&nbsp;your brain’s funny bone, as it were, through the right sorts of&nbsp;exercise, changing both your character, your brain, and&nbsp;(presumably) the shape of your skull.</p>
<p class="font4">Fashionable citizens flocked to phrenologists to have their “heads examined”—with decidedly mixed results. Samuel L.&nbsp;Clemens (better known as Mark Twain) visited a prominent&nbsp;phrenologist in 1873, under another assumed name.<a name="footnote35"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark40">35</a></sup><sup></sup> The good&nbsp;doctor discovered something remarkable about his anonymous&nbsp;patient: a “total absence of the sense of humor.”<a name="footnote36"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark41">36</a></sup><sup></sup> Three months&nbsp;later, the same phrenologist was delighted to welcome a very famous&nbsp;new patient: Mark Twain. During the examination of <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Twain,&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">the phrenologist discovered a “‘Mount Everest ... [of] a bump of&nbsp;humor.’”<a name="footnote37"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark42">37</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">Twain’s experience with phrenology was innocent fun, but phrenology had serious impacts on the criminal law in the United&nbsp;States and Europe. Phrenology informed criminal law reform&nbsp;proposals,<a name="footnote38"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark43">38</a></sup><sup></sup> jurists used phrenology to separate the criminal from&nbsp;the insane and to provide reliable ways to identify both;<a name="footnote39"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark44">39</a></sup><sup></sup> expert&nbsp;phrenological testimony was introduced at sentencing as a&nbsp;mitigating factor;<a name="footnote40"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark45">40</a></sup><sup></sup> and the founder of forensic psychiatry embraced&nbsp;phrenology as a way of showing the trier of fact the relationship&nbsp;between brain and behavior.<a name="footnote41"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark46">41</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">“Prophylactic” phrenology was proposed to determine who might be a risk for criminal behavior in the future.<a name="footnote42"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark47">42</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Indeed,</p>
<p class="font4">police departments even claimed to put this theory into practice, training their detectives to arrest “criminal types”—&nbsp;who had not to their knowledge committed any crime—on&nbsp;sight. “Keen observers have over and over again marked and&nbsp;arrested apparently inoffensive rogues, whom they had never&nbsp;seen before in person or in pictures.”<a name="footnote43"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark48">43</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Phrenology also influenced the M’Naughten test for insanity; that test’s separation of the ability to know right from wrong from&nbsp;the rest of the accused’s state of mental disease reflects the&nbsp;phrenological notion of distinct mental “organs,” in significant&nbsp;contrast to other, more integrative views of mind and mental&nbsp;disorder.<a name="footnote44"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark49">44</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Judges turned to phrenology to determine the sanity of murderers (and for many civil uses, as well, such as ascertaining the&nbsp;capacity of testators and witnesses).<a name="footnote45"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark50">45</a></sup><sup></sup> In <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Farrer v. State,</span><span class="font4"> for&nbsp;example, an 1853 murder case, the Ohio Supreme Court turned to&nbsp;phrenology in considering whether a housekeeper could be held&nbsp;criminally responsible for poisoning a young boy.<a name="footnote46"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark51">46</a></sup><sup></sup> The judge wrote&nbsp;that the housekeeper was “remarkably ugly.”<a name="footnote47"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark52">47</a></sup><sup></sup> All but diagnosing&nbsp;her from the bench, the judge noted that a phrenologist would just&nbsp;have to look at the shape of her head to know she was criminally&nbsp;insane, with murderous impulses.<a name="footnote48"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark53">48</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote49"></a><a href="#bookmark54">49</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">Another judge, in an 1840 civil case concerning the capacity of a testator, spoke for the pervasive influence of phrenology on legal&nbsp;culture when he stated that:</p>
<p class="font4">[N]o man having any regard for his reputation in medical science, would dispute that the brain . . . consist[s] of&nbsp;distinct organs, each having a distinct function, and that&nbsp;power of function is influenced by organic size.</p>
<p class="font4">Yet, by the mid-1900s, phrenology, this “true science of the mind” that had influenced criminal laws, criminal and civil trials,&nbsp;and the course of peoples’ lives, had the status of a joke. Not only&nbsp;was phrenology discarded as a tool of justice—much less the path to&nbsp;“Reform The World . . . [and] Perfect our Republic,”<a name="footnote50"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark55">50</a></sup><sup></sup>—it was banned&nbsp;in many U.S. jurisdictions alongside “fortune telling” and&nbsp;astrology.<a name="footnote51"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark56">51</a></sup><sup></sup> In recent jurisprudence, phrenology has been classed&nbsp;with “voodoo.”<a name="footnote52"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark57">52</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">This spectacular fall from grace came in the normal way: scientists challenged phrenology internally to science, while social&nbsp;theories about the nature of the mind—particularly with the advent&nbsp;of Freudian psychoanalysis in the early twentieth century—&nbsp;challenged it externally, ultimately resulting in an integrative&nbsp;paradigm of mind with no place for fixed “brain organs.” As early as&nbsp;1838, neuroanatomists had shown that the brain did not have&nbsp;enough discrete regions to support the claim that all major&nbsp;personality traits could arise from specialized brain organs.<a name="footnote53"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark58">53</a></sup><sup></sup> Many&nbsp;showed, as well, that the various parts of the brain need to work in&nbsp;concert to produce most types of actions.<a name="footnote54"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark59">54</a></sup><sup></sup> Furthermore, it became&nbsp;clear—over much social contestation, particularly about race and&nbsp;sex—that brain size (and the size of parts of the brain) bore no clear&nbsp;relationship to aptitude,<a name="footnote55"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark60">55</a></sup><sup></sup> and that people could retain particular&nbsp;traits or abilities when the part of the brain in which the trait&nbsp;allegedly resided was destroyed by illness or injury.<a name="footnote56"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark61">56</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">If phrenology’s approach to the relationship between brain structure and character sounds unscientific, or even silly, pause: it&nbsp;is very close in certain respects to modem approaches.&nbsp;Phrenologists identified the biology of particular parts of the brain&nbsp;as the most relevant explanation for character and behavior—a&nbsp;person is a killer or a humorist based on his brain’s configuration.&nbsp;This makes the individual brain the most (perhaps the sole) relevant&nbsp;consideration in determining whether a person has a criminal&nbsp;nature. Furthermore, it turns actions that people do into statuses of&nbsp;what they are; a person who engages in a violent criminal act does&nbsp;so because he <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font4"> a biological criminal, someone physically different&nbsp;from law-abiding people.</span></p>
<p class="font4">Although phrenology ultimately failed as a science, and lives as the pseudoscience <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span><span class="font4"> in the public and judicial&nbsp;imagination,<a name="footnote57"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark62">57</a></sup><sup></sup> “it left behind a formalized concept of cerebral&nbsp;localization” of complex behaviors and of root biological difference&nbsp;between law-breaking and law-abiding people.<a name="footnote58"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark63">58</a></sup><sup></sup> This way of&nbsp;thinking about brain structure and its relationship to criminality&nbsp;left the door open to the notion that “a science not too different from&nbsp;. . . phrenology . . . could be used” to investigate putative biological&nbsp;difference between people who commit criminal acts and others.<a name="footnote59"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark64">59</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>That legacy soon would be picked up by a young doctor whose&nbsp;Zeitgeist included phrenology, Cesare Lombroso.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2. Lombrosian Biological Criminology&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">Shortly after the demise of phrenology, “biological criminology” (or “criminal anthropology”)<a name="footnote60"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark65">60</a></sup><sup></sup> sprang from the brain of a criminal.&nbsp;When Cesare Lombroso was a young doctor at the asylum in Pavia,&nbsp;he was asked to conduct a postmortem on an infamous serial rapist&nbsp;and murderer. Opening the criminal’s skull to reveal his brain, Dr.&nbsp;Lombroso had an insight “like a flash of light.”<a name="footnote61"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark66">61</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">He claimed to have found numerous abnormal features of the brain (as well as the skull), including an enlargement of the&nbsp;cerebellum<a name="footnote62"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark67">62</a></sup><sup></sup> “like that found in the lower types of apes, rodents, and&nbsp;birds.”<a name="footnote63"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark68">63</a></sup><sup></sup> In this moment, from this brain, Lombroso formed his&nbsp;famous theory of atavistic criminality—that is, that criminality&nbsp;results from a person having a throw-back brain to something lower&nbsp;than the “primitive savages”: indeed, back to the “carnivor[es].”<a name="footnote64"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark69">64</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Although biological criminology later embraced other “atavistic”&nbsp;features of born criminals that linked them to the “primitive races”&nbsp;(such as longer forearms and, absurdly, “the prehensile foot”),<a name="footnote65"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark70">65</a></sup><sup></sup> it is&nbsp;the head of the criminal—the house of the criminal mind—that gave&nbsp;rise to the biological criminology movement.</p>
<p class="font4">In her well-known treatise <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Man,</span><span class="font4"> Gina Lombroso Ferrero (Cesare’s daughter) wrote of the biological differences&nbsp;between criminal and noncriminal individuals, emphasizing&nbsp;differences in the head and “psychic [mental] and sensitive [nervous&nbsp;system] functions . . . ”<a name="footnote66"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark71">66</a></sup><sup></sup> Leaving no doubt about her view of the&nbsp;origins of these differences, she entitled her central chapter “The&nbsp;Born Criminal.”<a name="footnote67"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark72">67</a></sup><sup></sup> In it, she writes that the “Modern, or Positive,&nbsp;School of Penal Jurisprudence” maintains that people become&nbsp;criminals as a result of their atavistic “psychic organisation,” which&nbsp;“differs essentially from that of normal individuals”; indeed,&nbsp;criminals’ brain structure and nervous systems “strongly resemble&nbsp;primitive races.”<a name="footnote68"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark73">68</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">Lombroso’s claims that criminals have atavistic brains sparked a craze for brain dissection.<a name="footnote69"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark74">69</a></sup><sup></sup> Generally, the results of these&nbsp;dissections proved disappointing: they did not confirm any&nbsp;systematic differences in the gross anatomy of violent criminals’&nbsp;brains relative to those not convicted of criminal offenses.<a name="footnote70"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark75">70</a></sup><sup></sup> But&nbsp;Lombroso and his followers were not dissuaded by these facts: while&nbsp;they acknowledged that the abnormalities Lombroso described in his&nbsp;first specimen were not present in “other degenerates,” different&nbsp;brain abnormalities nevertheless were “prevalent in criminals.”<a name="footnote71"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark76">71</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>The absence of any consistent correlations between structural brain&nbsp;defects and criminality seemed to reflect only that the brain is “a&nbsp;very recalcitrant organ [that] gives us an infinite deal of trouble&nbsp;when we attempt to establish positive relations between its&nbsp;substance and the operations of the faculties of the mind . . . ,”<a name="footnote72"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark77">72</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">The failure of brain dissection to confirm systematic differences between criminals and noncriminals tempered some claims by&nbsp;Lombrosians. However, they did not retreat from claims about&nbsp;brain differences related to violence. Gina Lombroso Ferrero&nbsp;acknowledged that “lesser criminals” may not possess atavistic&nbsp;brains; yet, those who commit “peculiarly monstrous” crimes, like&nbsp;murder, nearly always demonstrate the “atavistic” brains of&nbsp;animals.<a name="footnote73"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark78">73</a></sup><sup></sup> There is no evidence that the brain dissections of this era&nbsp;did produce findings of structural brain differences between&nbsp;perpetrators of violent crimes versus nonviolent crimes (or of&nbsp;noncriminals); yet, the insistence on physical differences violent&nbsp;criminals’ brains seemed particularly “sticky,” difficult to dislodge in&nbsp;light of countervailing evidence.</p>
<p class="font4">Lombrosian biological criminology reveals fascinating parallels to contemporary claims about the neurological bases of violent&nbsp;crime. Today’s assertion that “crime [is] a disease”<a name="footnote74"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark79">74</a></sup><sup></sup> flowing from&nbsp;disordered “neurobiology” echos the claims of early twentieth&nbsp;century biological criminologists like L. Hamilton McCormick, who&nbsp;asserted, “[c]rime is . . . pathological”; it is “pathological, as it is&nbsp;owing to morbid affections of the brain that men frequently adopt&nbsp;crime as a profession.”<a name="footnote75"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark80">75</a></sup><sup></sup> Placed side-by-side without citations, a&nbsp;reader would have difficulty distinguishing the Lombrosian&nbsp;statement from the new neurolaw statement—one claims that&nbsp;“crime [is] a disease” and the other that “crime is . . . pathological”;&nbsp;one says it flows from “neurobiology,” and one says it flows from the&nbsp;“brain.” The current view is that violence emerges from disorders of&nbsp;the prefrontal cortex, which is said to regulate executive function&nbsp;and judgment; the nineteenth century criminal anthropologists&nbsp;claimed a relationship to deficits in the “the antero-superior district&nbsp;of the brain,” roughly equivalent to the prefrontal cortex, “which&nbsp;betokens morality and trustworthiness . . . .”<a name="footnote76"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark81">76</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote77"></a><a href="#bookmark82">77</a></sup></p>
<p class="font4">If the ghosts of Lombroso were those of mere bad science— faulty data or superseded hypotheses—we could look back but&nbsp;fleetingly at the specter. But it signifies more. Lombroso is a&nbsp;synecdoche for the hope that a biological criminology is possible,&nbsp;that the laws of man can yield to the laws of science. A&nbsp;contemporary critic of biological criminology (or “criminal&nbsp;anthropology”) spoke to its shortcomings in language that could&nbsp;apply equally to the neurolaw of today, saying that the field:</p>
<p class="font4">[O]ccupies the debatable ground between science and philosophy. As a science, it is positive and aggressive. As a&nbsp;philosophy, it consists almost wholly of negations, the chief of&nbsp;which are the negation of spirit, of freedom of the will, and of&nbsp;moral responsibility.<sup><a href="#bookmark82">77</a></sup><sup></sup></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1. Psychointervention’s Promise to Cure Violence</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">While biological criminology fell into disrepute, like phrenology before it, it nevertheless helped spawn the next set of tragic errors&nbsp;in the relationship between criminal law and brain science: direct&nbsp;brain interventions against the putative neurobiology of violence. In&nbsp;the tumultuous middle of the twentieth century, it seemed that&nbsp;“[hjuman violence [was] the most threatening problem in our world&nbsp;. . . ”<a name="footnote78"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark83">78</a></sup><sup></sup> But the so-called violence problem, fortunately, appeared&nbsp;“solvable”—through the miracles of psychosurgery (lobotomy)<a name="footnote79"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark84">79</a></sup><sup></sup> and&nbsp;electrode implantation.<a name="footnote80"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark85">80</a></sup><sup></sup> This enthusiasm for psychointervention&nbsp;carried forward beliefs about the brain as the best level on which to&nbsp;address criminality, the localization of violence to specific parts of&nbsp;the brain, and about the biological differences between people who&nbsp;do and do not commit violent crimes.</p>
<p class="font4">These continuities between mid-century psychointervention and prior criminal law-brain science movements are not only thematic&nbsp;but actually historical. Psychosurgery’s earliest founder, Gottleib&nbsp;Burckhardt, drew his inspiration directly from the claims of innate&nbsp;brain difference advanced by Lombrosian criminology and&nbsp;phrenology. Reasoning that “[o]ur psychological existence is&nbsp;composed of single elements, which are localized in separate areas of&nbsp;the brain,” Burckhardt believed that he could literally “extirpat[e]”&nbsp;unwanted behaviors by removing specific portions of the brain.<a name="footnote81"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark86">81</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">In 1891, Burckhardt tested this idea by removing the cerebral cortices<a name="footnote82"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark87">82</a></sup><sup></sup> of six people confined in his asylum in Prefargier,&nbsp;Switzerland.<a name="footnote83"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark88">83</a></sup><sup></sup> His results were poor (one patient died and five&nbsp;remained at least as psychotic) and so it was not until nearly fifty&nbsp;years later that psychosurgery took off—following the chance&nbsp;encounter of a Portuguese politician and some apathetic monkeys.<a name="footnote84"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark89">84</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">In 1935, Antonio Egas Moniz, a retired Portuguese ambassador with training in neuroscience, attended the International Congress&nbsp;of Neurology in Boston.<a name="footnote85"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark90">85</a></sup><sup></sup> There, two American researchers, John&nbsp;Fulton and Carlyle Jacobsen, presented their results on lesions in&nbsp;the frontal lobes and/or amygdalae of monkeys and chimpanzees:&nbsp;these primates ordinarily were hostile to researchers but, after&nbsp;bilateral lesions to their frontal lobes, were “strikingly indifferent to&nbsp;stimuli that preoperatively provoked responses of extreme agitation&nbsp;and frustration.”<a name="footnote86"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark91">86</a></sup><sup></sup> They showed drastic behavioral changes,&nbsp;including deficits in learning and memory, but also were listless or&nbsp;tame.<a name="footnote87"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark92">87</a></sup><sup></sup> Moniz asked the presenters if similar surgery could “relieve&nbsp;anxiety states” in people.<a name="footnote88"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark93">88</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Fulton and Jacobsen were shocked at Moniz’s suggestion, but Moniz put his idea into action immediately. On his return to&nbsp;Portugal, Moniz and a colleague performed twenty surgeries in a&nbsp;ten-week period on human subjects in which they destroyed portions&nbsp;of the patients’ frontal lobes.<a name="footnote89"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark94">89</a></sup><sup></sup> Touting his successes, Moniz claimed&nbsp;that these people were miraculously “cured,” and that those “who&nbsp;had previously been violent. . . became calm, tractable, and&nbsp;generally easier to manage.”<a name="footnote90"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark95">90</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote91"></a><a href="#bookmark96">91</a></sup> Lobotomy as a treatment for violence,&nbsp;cloaked in a heavy degree of (possibly self-deluding)&nbsp;misrepresentation about its safety and efficacy, was born.</p>
<p class="font4">Moniz’s purported successes with frontal lobe surgery (hence “lobe-otomy”) led him to be awarded the Nobel Prize in 1949.&quot; And,&nbsp;it led to tens of thousands of psychosurgeries in the United States&nbsp;and around the world. In the United States alone, about 70,000&nbsp;people were subjects of lobotomy between the 1940s and mid-1960s.<a name="footnote92"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark97">92</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">The fascination with brain-based causes of and potential “cures” for violence pervaded brain sciences in the mid-century. Animal&nbsp;studies, particularly with monkeys, rats, and one very famous bull,&nbsp;seemed to point the way toward controlling man’s more animal&nbsp;nature. Proselytizers for the criminal law applications of “sedative&nbsp;psychosurgery,” as they called it, Vernon Mark and Frank Ervin&nbsp;drew heavily on the same kind of monkey studies that first inspired&nbsp;Moniz. Mark and Ervin noted that “after both temporal lobes have&nbsp;been removed,” monkeys are “placid, can be easily handled, and do&nbsp;not respond aggressively even to attack . . . ,”<a name="footnote93"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark98">93</a></sup><sup></sup> They also seem&nbsp;without anxiety, putting objects in their mouths “that ordinarily&nbsp;provoke fear, such as small snakes.”<a name="footnote94"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark99">94</a></sup><sup></sup> Showing even more dramatic&nbsp;examples of subduing primal violence, “[localized removal of the&nbsp;amygdala will tame a predatory and vicious lynx or a wolverine.”<a name="footnote95"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark100">95</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Analogizing people who have committed criminal violence to the&nbsp;“lynx or . . . wolverine,” they note that, “[i]ndeed, neurosurgeons&nbsp;have surgically removed areas of the amygdala to treat assaultive&nbsp;behavior in patients . . . ,”<a name="footnote96"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark101">96</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Around the same time, “an alternate form of psychosurgery”<a name="footnote97"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark102">97</a></sup><sup></sup>— electrical stimulation of parts of the brain—also promised a solution&nbsp;to the “violence problem.” Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the&nbsp;criminal law and scientific communities together explored electrical&nbsp;brain stimulation as a method to “effectively wipe out violence” in&nbsp;society.<a name="footnote98"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark103">98</a></sup><sup></sup> The majority of this work consisted of electrical&nbsp;stimulation of parts of animals’ brains to evoke or suppress what the&nbsp;researchers characterized as violent behavior or inappropriate&nbsp;sexual behavior. In perhaps the most dramatic piece of theater a&nbsp;scientist ever staged, Dr. Jose Delgado of Yale University organized&nbsp;a bullfight—a special bullfight designed to show the triumph of&nbsp;neuroscience over animal aggression. Delgado arranged a ‘“brave&nbsp;bull,’ a variety bred to respond with a raging charge when it sees&nbsp;any human being.”<a name="footnote99"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark104">99</a></sup><sup></sup> Delgado implanted an electrode in the caudate&nbsp;nucleus of the bull’s brain and, before a packed audience of&nbsp;scientists, media, and others, Delgado stopped the charging bull by&nbsp;activating the electrode—the power of science stopping animal&nbsp;aggression in its tracks.<a name="footnote100"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark105">100</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Delgado’s work seemed to hold tremendous and direct promise for law enforcement. Recruited by government agencies, Delgado&nbsp;worked for many years (although fruitlessly) on a brain-computer&nbsp;interface and on brain stimulation techniques to control human&nbsp;violence.<a name="footnote101"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark106">101</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font4">2. <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Psychointervention and Criminal Law Initiatives</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">While psychointervention, like phrenology and biological criminology, started out in asylums, it, too, soon made inroads into&nbsp;criminal law through its participation in the discourse on violence.<a name="footnote102"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark107">102</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Indeed, if psychosurgery could fix the brain “dysfunction” causing&nbsp;violent conduct among the mentally ill, why stop at the asylum&nbsp;gates? Psychointervention might quell civil unrest (associated with&nbsp;the mid-century struggle for civil rights) and all kinds of other&nbsp;criminal violence.<a name="footnote103"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark108">103</a></sup><sup></sup> Particularly, psychosurgery might “treat”&nbsp;urban rioters, leaders of civil unrest (i.e., those involved in the civil&nbsp;rights movement), and violent prisoners of all kinds.<a name="footnote104"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark109">104</a></sup><sup></sup> As the&nbsp;heralds of this transition of psychosurgery from a psychiatric&nbsp;treatment to an all-purpose social curative wrote,&nbsp;psychointervention offers “a new and biologically oriented approach&nbsp;to the problem of human violence.”<a name="footnote105"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark110">105</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Under the view of mind and behavior that animated psychointervention, violence can only arise from brain disorder—&nbsp;because with a “well-ordered brain,” a person “need never be out of&nbsp;control.”<a name="footnote106"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark111">106</a></sup><sup></sup> If a person does go “out of control,” then there are only&nbsp;two possible reasons: “either the limbic system [which includes the&nbsp;amygdala] has become pathologically hyperactive” or “its neocortical&nbsp;[frontal lobe—executive function] (control) inputs have become&nbsp;abnormal.”<a name="footnote107"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark112">107</a></sup><sup></sup> In their landmark book <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Violence and the Brain,&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Professors Mark and Ervin of Harvard and MIT argued that such&nbsp;“brain malfunction” causes “a low threshold for impulsive violence”&nbsp;and that people convicted of a crime involving violence likely suffer&nbsp;from such brain disease.<a name="footnote108"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark113">108</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">Deriding views that crime rates reflect levels of policing, or socioeconomic or demographic factors, these researchers asserted&nbsp;that criminal violence is caused and explained exclusively by the&nbsp;perpetrators’ disordered neurobiology.<a name="footnote109"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark114">109</a></sup><sup></sup> Thus, they recommended&nbsp;that people convicted of crimes of violence should have&nbsp;psychosurgery to remove their amygdalae.<a name="footnote110"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark115">110</a></sup><sup></sup> In this, Mark and&nbsp;Ervin were emblematic of a broader movement in the biological&nbsp;control of violence and particularly of proposals to perform&nbsp;psychosurgery or electrode implantation on prisoners.<a name="footnote111"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark116">111</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">While mass lobotomization of urban protesters and prisoners never did take place, a few experiments on prisoners tested out the&nbsp;idea.<a name="footnote112"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark117">112</a></sup><sup></sup> In 1968, under the auspices of the California Department of&nbsp;Corrections, several prisoners (including one minor) at the Vacaville&nbsp;State Penitentiary in Vacaville, California, underwent surgical&nbsp;implantation of electrodes for the purpose of destroying amygdalar&nbsp;tissue; the goal was to eradicate their desire and ability to engage in&nbsp;violent behavior.<a name="footnote113"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark118">113</a></sup><sup></sup> The experiment was carried out by a military&nbsp;surgeon from a nearby air force base, and Vacaville used its&nbsp;metalwork shop to craft a special device to hold the prisoners’ heads&nbsp;in place for the procedure.<a name="footnote114"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark119">114</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">The Vacaville experiment produced poor results: the one prisoner whose surgery the prison authorities deemed successful,&nbsp;and who was paroled, was rearrested for robbery almost&nbsp;immediately after his release.<a name="footnote115"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark120">115</a></sup><sup></sup> Nevertheless, enthusiasm for&nbsp;solving criminal problems through psychointerventions went on&nbsp;unabated. In 1972, the Neuropsychiatric Institute of the University&nbsp;of California at Los Angeles proposed to develop a Center for the&nbsp;Study and Reduction of Violence, intended to identify violent&nbsp;predispositions and develop brain-based techniques for preventing&nbsp;and treating violent behavior.<a name="footnote116"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark121">116</a></sup><sup></sup> The Center was to be funded&nbsp;primarily by the federal Law Enforcement Assistance&nbsp;Administration (“LEAA”).<a name="footnote117"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark122">117</a></sup><sup></sup> In furtherance of its violenceprevention strategy, the LEAA also extensively funded research into&nbsp;brain implants and other brain intervention techniques.<a name="footnote118"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark123">118</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Ultimately, the once-heralded efforts to address criminal problems through psychosurgery and electrostimulation led&nbsp;lawmakers and neuroscientists alike to call to restrict the&nbsp;procedures, particularly on prisoners and children.<a name="footnote119"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark124">119</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Psychointervention is easy to dismiss as horrifying but irrelevant;&nbsp;the technology seems primitive, and there is little risk that similar&nbsp;technologies would be tested on prisoners and incompetents today,&nbsp;given the advent of rigorous Internal Review Boards for human&nbsp;experimentation and heightened ethical awareness.<a name="footnote120"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark125">120</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Yet, psychointervention has immediate lessons now. While we now know that the claims of psychointervention were inflated and&nbsp;we reject its abuses, its logic—like that of phrenology—is both&nbsp;elegant and fully consistent with prior movements in understanding&nbsp;violence entirely internal to the brain: either violent people have&nbsp;disordered thoughts,<a name="footnote121"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark126">121</a></sup><sup></sup> produced by frontal lobes disorder; or they&nbsp;have abnormal fear and rage reactions, which arise from the&nbsp;amygdala.<a name="footnote122"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark127">122</a></sup><sup></sup> The investigator then tries to solve what he or she has&nbsp;defined as the <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">brain’s</span><span class="font4"> violence problem through brain intervention—&nbsp;a seductively simple solution to a multifaceted and complex set of&nbsp;problems. In this, we see a version of the same argument currently&nbsp;advanced in reductionist approaches to neuroscience in criminal&nbsp;law—that dysfunction of the amygdala (or other parts of the brain&nbsp;regulating emotional processing), or of the frontal lobes, is the most&nbsp;prevalent and relevant cause of violent crime.</span></p>

<p class="font4">While many kinds of behaviors might be of legal and social interest,<a name="footnote123"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark128">123</a></sup><sup></sup> there “is a marked tendency” in neurobiological&nbsp;discussions of crime “to focus on violent behaviors.”<a name="footnote124"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark129">124</a></sup><sup></sup> Indeed, the&nbsp;“[p]rediction of violence,” as well as its control, is a central, shared&nbsp;interest of “science [and] the legal system” and is likely to remain a&nbsp;core area of collaboration between these fields.<a name="footnote125"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark130">125</a></sup><sup></sup> For this reason,&nbsp;there is “a massive (and growing) body of scientific literature on&nbsp;both the neuroanatomical and neurochemical bases” of violence.<a name="footnote126"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark131">126</a></sup><sup></sup></p>

<p class="font4">While this is intended to be humane, it is worth keeping in mind Paul Robinson’s argument that “the harshness of the current&nbsp;system may be attributed in largest part to the move to&nbsp;rehabilitation, incapacitation, and deterrence, which <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">disconnected&nbsp;criminal punishment from the constraint of just desert.”<a name="footnote129"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark134">129</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>

<p class="font4">Members of several fields who currently work on criminal violence assert that criminal violence arises as a result of&nbsp;dysregulation of the prefrontal cortex (“pfc”) and the amygdale—&nbsp;indeed, that these parts of the brain “play preeminent roles in&nbsp;[violent] behavior.”<a name="footnote130"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark135">130</a></sup><sup></sup> So far, the “core findings” on violence and the&nbsp;brain are that the amygdala is involved in “fear and other negative&nbsp;emotions,” while the orbitofrontal cortex (a portion of the pfc)&nbsp;contributes to “constraining impulsive outbursts!.]”<a name="footnote131"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark136">131</a></sup><sup></sup> According to&nbsp;proponents of this view, a diverse body of research, including new&nbsp;neuroimaging and older animal studies, supports the notion that&nbsp;violent behavior initiates in the amygdala and that its expression is&nbsp;regulated by the pfc.<a name="footnote132"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark137">132</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Impressive, even astounding, statistics support the claim that frontal lobe or pfc dysfunction is the major cause of all kinds of&nbsp;violent crime. Professor Richard Redding, citing Dr. Adrian Raine’s&nbsp;studies of incarcerated criminals, contends that “the prevalence rate&nbsp;[sic] of brain dysfunction . . . [is] <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ninety-four percent</span><span class="font4"> among homicide&nbsp;offenders, [and] sixty-one percent among habitually aggressive&nbsp;adults . . . ,”<a name="footnote133"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark138">133</a></sup><sup></sup> By contrast, the claimed “prevalence rate [of brain&nbsp;dysfunction] in the general population is only </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">three percent.”<a name="footnote134"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark139">134</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">While some more cautious legal scholars and neuroscience researchers note that the causal relationship between the degree of&nbsp;frontal lobe activity and any specific conduct is at best&nbsp;unestablished,<a name="footnote135"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark140">135</a></sup><sup></sup> others leap forward: we are asked to believe that&nbsp;“neuroscience research. . . provides <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">compelling explanatory&nbsp;evidence”</span><span class="font4"> that frontal lobe dysfunction plays “a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">causal</span><span class="font4"> role” in most&nbsp;types of violent crime.<a name="footnote136"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark141">136</a></sup><sup></sup> Following this view, understanding pfc and&nbsp;amygdalar dysfunction should provide the foundation for future&nbsp;“criminology, crime prevention efforts, and the functioning of the&nbsp;criminal justice system.”<a name="footnote137"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark142">137</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">B. Claims that Particular Crimes Arise from Specific Neural Patterns—A Biological Basis for Terrorism?</span></p>
<p class="font4">Related to the claims that dysfunction in two key brain regions are involved in violent crime, some scholars contend that particular&nbsp;types of neural activation patterns within these and related regions&nbsp;give rise to specific violent crimes. Future work, it is claimed, may&nbsp;establish the biological basis for all types of human violence,&nbsp;including “[a]cts of ethnic cleansing, school shootings, bombings,&nbsp;hostage takings, [and] incidents of terrorism . . . ,”<a name="footnote138"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark143">138</a></sup><sup></sup> It is suggested&nbsp;that there may be a unique “neural topograph [y]” for every crime&nbsp;ranging from “sadistic murder[ ]” to “political terroris[m].”<a name="footnote139"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark144">139</a></sup><sup></sup> This&nbsp;understanding, in turn, “will contribute to [the] detection, control,&nbsp;and alleviation” of violent crime, in part through predicting a&nbsp;person’s “level of dangerousness, and risk of recidivism . . . .”<a name="footnote140"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark145">140</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Additionally, with such an understanding of the causes (or at least markers) of particular crimes, lawmakers may be able to&nbsp;approach different types of criminal violence based on the&nbsp;(putatively) distinct neurobiology of each.<a name="footnote141"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark146">141</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">What is the basis for these claims? Research on the neurobiology of bombers themselves is extremely limited (and&nbsp;necessarily excludes subjects who might be of the greatest interest,&nbsp;successful suicide bombers).<a name="footnote142"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark147">142</a></sup><sup></sup> The most comprehensive study of&nbsp;school shooters, issued in 2000 by the FBI, focused on behavioral&nbsp;warning signs; it did not investigate school shooters on the&nbsp;neurobiological level.<a name="footnote143"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark148">143</a></sup><sup></sup> To date, no studies have been conducted on&nbsp;neurobiology and terrorism<a name="footnote144"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark149">144</a></sup><sup></sup> or neurobiology and ethnic or political&nbsp;violence. Rather, these claims that specific crimes arise from&nbsp;specific brain dysfunction grow out of two important but indirect&nbsp;strands of research: decades of experiments on aggression in&nbsp;animals, and a few recent human studies using functional magnetic&nbsp;resonance imaging (“fMRI”).<a name="footnote145"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark150">145</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Animal models of aggression have provided the basis for research on human violence for about a century. In these studies,&nbsp;cats and rats display different patterns of brain activation&nbsp;depending on whether they were provoked to display “defensive&nbsp;rage” or “predatory aggression.”<a name="footnote146"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark151">146</a></sup><sup></sup> (In ordinary English, “defensive&nbsp;rage” and “predatory aggression” in cats and rats translate roughly&nbsp;to “guarding territory from other cats or rats” and “preying on rats&nbsp;or mice.”) Violence researchers have extrapolated from these&nbsp;distinct patterns of aggression in animals that people, similarly,&nbsp;may have different neurological bases for what they call “hot”&nbsp;violence—crimes of sudden rage, like heat of passion crimes—and&nbsp;“cold” crimes of premeditation, like the proverbial cold-blooded&nbsp;killing.<a name="footnote147"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark152">147</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">In one recent article, <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Law, Responsibility, and the Brain,</span><span class="font4"> the authors argue that a universal brain circuitry may underlie people’s&nbsp;“defensive” violent acts (like justified self-defense, as well as&nbsp;inappropriate violent responses to what a similarly situated&nbsp;reasonable person would not perceive as a threat) versus their&nbsp;“predatory” aggressive acts, like an act of revenge, a crime for&nbsp;financial gain, or other premeditated violent crimes.<a name="footnote148"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark153">148</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Extrapolating further from the general categories of defensive and&nbsp;predatory aggression in cats and rats, the authors propose that&nbsp;distinct “neural topographies” may underlie specific types of crimes,&nbsp;ranging from “sadistic murder [ ]” to “political terroris[m].”<a name="footnote149"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark154">149</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">On one level, these types of claims that distinct patterns of neural activation underlie different behaviors must be true: insofar&nbsp;as there is a materialist basis for all human thought and action,&nbsp;there likely are distinct neurobiological correlates for thinking of or&nbsp;engaging in any X versus any Y—say, liking or not liking a&nbsp;particular restaurant.<a name="footnote150"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark155">150</a></sup><sup></sup> That proposition is likely to be&nbsp;uncontroversial, but also merely trivially true; it tells us nothing&nbsp;about <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">causation—</span><span class="font4">about the relationship between observed neural&nbsp;activation patterns, why those patterns are present, and how they&nbsp;relate to why people do the things they do.<a name="footnote151"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark156">151</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">The claim that a distinct “neural topography” might underlie “sadistic murder” or “political terrorism” is a much larger claim than&nbsp;the trivial truth claim above: this claim is not that brain activation&nbsp;patterns reflect and enable everything that people do (and that, on&nbsp;average, very similar patterns will underlie the same actions across&nbsp;neurotypical people). Instead, it is the claim that people engage in&nbsp;particular crimes <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">because of</span><span class="font4"> specific, disordered neurobiology. At a&nbsp;minimum, under this view, the brain of a political terrorist would&nbsp;function differently from that of a sexual sadist; at the most, a&nbsp;person would become a terrorist or sexual sadist </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">because</span><span class="font4"> he&nbsp;possessed a certain functional or structural neurobiological&nbsp;predisposition or defect. The authors expressly embrace this more&nbsp;radical claim, stating that while “[a]t first glance, such reasoning&nbsp;looks like phrenological folly,” nevertheless “studies strongly suggest&nbsp;that some kinds of criminal behaviour are associated with&nbsp;dysfunction of different regions of the brain.”<a name="footnote152"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark157">152</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">Only if the case is the latter is it meaningful to propose that lawmakers ought to approach crimes based on their distinct&nbsp;neurobiology—or that the criminal law finally could realize the&nbsp;Lombrosian dream of a biological criminology.<a name="footnote153"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark158">153</a></sup><sup></sup> Thus, this view of&nbsp;the neurobiology of violence, like its forbearers in other criminal law&nbsp;and neuroscience movements, posits that disordered brains are the&nbsp;most relevant site at which to understand the cause of violent&nbsp;crimes, and that many people who commit crimes of violence do so&nbsp;as a result of neurobiological dysfunction.</p>
<p class="font4">A recent and striking example of this type of imaging study is Professor Martin Walter’s <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pedophilia Is Linked to Reduced&nbsp;Activation in Hypothalamus and Lateral Prefrontal Cortex During&nbsp;Visual Erotic Stimulation</span><span class="font4">.’<a name="footnote154"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark159">154</a></sup><sup></sup> Walter’s study is the first to use fMRI&nbsp;to compare the neurological responses of self-described pedophiles&nbsp;and self-described normal adults to erotic material featuring&nbsp;adults.<a name="footnote155"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark160">155</a></sup><sup></sup> The researchers scanned the subjects’ brains while the&nbsp;subjects looked at adult pornography. The fMRIs of pedophiles&nbsp;during the experiment showed reduced activation of the&nbsp;hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex “as compared to healthy&nbsp;individuals when they were viewing sexually arousing pictures of&nbsp;adults.”<a name="footnote156"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark161">156</a></sup><sup></sup> The study’s authors suggest that pedophilia may arise&nbsp;from a defective neurological activation pattern (too little activity in&nbsp;the hypothalamus).<a name="footnote157"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark162">157</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">Brain imaging studies ultimately may contribute to understanding the origins and treatment of pedophilia. But an&nbsp;imaging study like this one has less explanatory power than it at&nbsp;first might seem, and little relevance for criminal law regimes aimed&nbsp;at pedophiles. Essentially, the researchers here correlated sexual&nbsp;arousal with activity in certain parts of the brain. This in itself is&nbsp;an interesting result that helps confirm the role of certain parts of&nbsp;the brain in arousal, but it does not reveal much, if anything, about&nbsp;the causes of pedophilia—or whether people who do or do not show&nbsp;such an activation pattern ever will abuse a child.</p>
<p class="font4">The results of this study would be expected by anyone who subscribes to a materialist view of consciousness—that is, that all&nbsp;our thoughts and emotions have some physical, detectable reality.&nbsp;Subjects who said they were attracted to adults showed activity in&nbsp;structures associated with arousal when they looked at erotic&nbsp;pictures of adults. The subjects who said in advance of the scanning&nbsp;that they were <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font4"> attracted to adults did not show the same degree&nbsp;of activity in the those areas. This study thus neatly demonstrates&nbsp;that people show arousal when they see what turns them on and&nbsp;that they don’t when they don’t.<a name="footnote158"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark163">158</a></sup><sup></sup> This fits the materialist model&nbsp;perfectly but does not support taking the leap to claims about the&nbsp;causes of pedophilia or even, apart from causation, whether such&nbsp;scans could be used to predict behavior in, e.g., decisions about the&nbsp;release of an incarcerated pedophile.</span></p>
<p class="font4">Relatedly, this pedophilia study shows the degree to which scans may not reveal brain pathology <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">per se</span><span class="font4"> but simply neural&nbsp;correlates of thoughts and behaviors that may be harmful,&nbsp;antisocial, or illegal. If another experiment were run in which&nbsp;normal adults failed to show brain arousal in response to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">child&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">pornographic images, one might see the same lack of hypothalamic&nbsp;activation and concomitant absence of inhibitory pfc activity. Yet,&nbsp;we would not define that as evidence of a brain dysfunction or speak&nbsp;of hypothalamic “deficits” in the subjects; for good reasons, we do not&nbsp;consider lack of sexual attraction to children to be pathological.</span></p>
<p class="font4">Defining activation or lack of activation in particular parts of the brain as “disorder” or “dysfunction” necessarily must start from&nbsp;a normative position about the thing that is being described. And so&nbsp;these definitions of biological dysfunction based on correlating brain&nbsp;activation patterns with legally proscribed conduct have an element&nbsp;of circularity. When we do this, we are reasoning from conclusions&nbsp;about abnormality and back-fitting them into scanner patterns. But&nbsp;we as yet have no basis on which to conclude that the activation&nbsp;pattern causally produces the proscribed thing or represents a&nbsp;medical pathology.</p>

<p class="font4">Finally, scholars who contend that violence should be understood as a disease of localized brain dysfunction often point to&nbsp;one-off cases of outlandish injury or unusual disease to try to show&nbsp;that violence arises from disinhibition of the prefrontal cortex or&nbsp;dysfunction in the amygdala. In these case histories, damage to&nbsp;these areas causes previously law-abiding folk to transmogrify into&nbsp;impulsive, violent criminals—by extension, they support the&nbsp;implication that brain dysfunction is a major cause of criminal&nbsp;violence, making the individual brain the right level at which to&nbsp;explore and address such criminality.</p>
<p class="font4">The paradigmatic story of the relationship between frontal lobe dysfunction and violence, repeated in nearly all legal and popular&nbsp;science literature on the subject (and now to be repeated here), is&nbsp;that of Phineas Gage.<a name="footnote159"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark164">159</a></sup><sup></sup> Phineas Gage was a law-abiding railway&nbsp;worker who, in 1848, suffered a bizarre industrial accident: an&nbsp;explosive charge meant to drive an iron tamping rod into the ground&nbsp;backfired—and drove the rod through Gage’s cheek-bone, behind his&nbsp;eye socket, and out the top of his head.<a name="footnote160"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark165">160</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">In addition to the direct trauma to his skull and brain, he also suffered major hemorrhaging and a brain abscess.<a name="footnote161"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark166">161</a></sup><sup></sup> Amazingly,&nbsp;Gage’s injuries healed and he lived another thirteen years. Yet, he&nbsp;went through a marked change: he became ill-tempered and&nbsp;obstreperous.<a name="footnote162"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark167">162</a></sup><sup></sup> For the rest of his life, Gage suffered a variety of&nbsp;deficits and frequently was in minor trouble with the law.<a name="footnote163"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark168">163</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">The modem paradigmatic story linking violent criminality to brain disorder is the tragic story of Charles Whitman, an Eagle&nbsp;Scout, scholarship student at the University of Texas, and by all&nbsp;accounts loving husband and son, who murdered his wife, mother,&nbsp;and fourteen students at the University of Texas on August 1,&nbsp;1966.<a name="footnote164"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark169">164</a></sup><sup></sup> Whitman began to experience headaches and personality&nbsp;changes about a year before his attacks; he believed that he was&nbsp;suffering from a neurological problem and sought medical and lawenforcement help (including asking the police to arrest him earlier&nbsp;in the day that he committed his murders; the police were obliged to&nbsp;decline because Whitman had not yet committed any crime).<a name="footnote165"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark170">165</a></sup><sup></sup> A&nbsp;post-mortem shortly after Whitman was shot by police showed a&nbsp;large tumor compressing Whitman’s amygdaloid nucleus.<a name="footnote166"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark171">166</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">A few recent cases follow a similar pattern: a socially respectable man—a teacher, a stock broker—suffers a brain injury&nbsp;and morphs into a perpetrator of violence or sex crimes.<a name="footnote167"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark172">167</a></sup><sup></sup> When the&nbsp;brain injury heals (or the tumor is removed), the man returns to his&nbsp;gentle and law-abiding ways.</p>
<p class="font4">While neuroscientists caution against reading too much into such stories,<a name="footnote168"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark173">168</a></sup><sup></sup> less cautious criminal law and neuroscience</p>
<p class="font4">scholarship makes a direct connection between Gage’s accident and Whitman’s tumor to violent crime in general. The work <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Charles&nbsp;Whitman: The Amygdala and Mass Murder</span><span class="font4"> typifies the genre.<a name="footnote169"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark174">169</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>The Gage and Whitman cases figured prominently in the recent&nbsp;symposium on neuroscience and the criminal law at Baylor&nbsp;University’s center on Law, Brains, and Behavior. In the opening&nbsp;remarks of the conference, Dr. David Eagleman argued that the&nbsp;Whitman and Gage cases have important implications for criminal&nbsp;notions of culpability and provide the groundwork for understanding&nbsp;criminal violence as a medical problem arising from brain&nbsp;disorder.<a name="footnote170"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark175">170</a></sup><sup></sup> Similarly, major criminology textbooks use Whitman’s&nbsp;tumor as the starting point for a general explanation of violent&nbsp;crime as arising from brain dysfunction.<a name="footnote171"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark176">171</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">The role that these case histories play in the literature is to show that criminal violence is a pathology—that it can be produced&nbsp;by brain trauma and alleviated by brain correction.<a name="footnote172"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark177">172</a></sup><sup></sup> The view&nbsp;presented by this handful of brain trauma cases is that the most&nbsp;relevant level at which to understand the general phenomenon of&nbsp;criminal violence is internal to the individual—at the level of his or&nbsp;her neurobiology or neurochemistry—and, specifically, can be&nbsp;localized to the prefrontal cortex or amygdala. Finally, they present&nbsp;the claim that the violent person is fundamentally “Other,”&nbsp;essentially not-us, because he or she has a different (literally sick)&nbsp;brain. Thus, in these cases, we see all three of the major tenets of&nbsp;brain-behavior reductionism that historically have been manifest in&nbsp;past episodes of brain sciences in the criminal law.</p>

<p class="font4">III. <span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Methodological Issues with Current Law and the&nbsp;Neuroscience of Violence</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">Bringing together anecdote and image, stories about the localization of violence in the brain are almost irresistible. They&nbsp;apparently have the most current and sexy science behind them, as&nbsp;well as decades of animal and human trauma research. Yet, there is&nbsp;“an enormous chasm” between what it is scientifically legitimate to&nbsp;say about “the localization problem” and what has “been concluded&nbsp;from well-intentioned, but inadequately reasoned research . . . ,”<a name="footnote173"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark178">173</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>While it may not at first seem legitimate to lump the law and&nbsp;neuroscience of the new millennium with the science of lumps from&nbsp;the 1800s, this Part will show that infirmities continue to dog efforts&nbsp;to equate criminal violence with localized brain dysfunction—and&nbsp;that, for reasons inherent to the ways in which localization&nbsp;questions are posed, and the legal (not biological) content of&nbsp;definitions of criminal violence, likely will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="font4">To evaluate the claims that criminal violence is the result of brain dysfunction, this Part first will examine the current state of&nbsp;research on the localization of basic and higher brain processes.&nbsp;Starting with sensory-motor functions, it will show that, even for&nbsp;these relatively simple functions, the localization enterprise runs&nbsp;into problems. It then examines the state of research concerning the&nbsp;localizability of violence to the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, and&nbsp;some efforts to localize violence that have relied on celebrated brain&nbsp;injury cases, like Phineas Gage and Charles Whitman.</p>
<p class="font4">As a final, formal barrier to localizing violence in the brain, this Part will suggest that “violence,” may be better understood as a&nbsp;legal term and a psychological construct than a biological thing.&nbsp;Legal institutions are essential to defining violence, as shown by the&nbsp;ways that legal definitions of what conduct constitutes violence&nbsp;change across place and time. Even outside of the legal domain, the&nbsp;concept of violence may have no specific biological reality; rather, it&nbsp;may be understood as a psychological construct—a term like&nbsp;“intelligence” or “attachment” that covers a range of mental&nbsp;activities and outward behaviors.</p>
<p class="font4">Each of these issues that present a barrier to the straightforward localization of violence could be the subject of a&nbsp;book; while it is beyond this Article to address each of these issues&nbsp;comprehensively, this Part sketches them to inform the legal reader&nbsp;of the active controversies surrounding the study of brain function&nbsp;and violence. Furthermore, each of these questions goes back to the&nbsp;touchstone issues introduced in the beginning of this Article:&nbsp;whether the individual brain (or isolated parts of the brain) is the&nbsp;most relevant level at which to examine problems of criminal&nbsp;violence; whether it is possible to localize a heterogeneous set of&nbsp;behaviors called “violence” to dysfunction in parts of the brain; and&nbsp;whether people who engage in criminal violence may be biologically&nbsp;different from people who do not.</p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. What We Know About Localization Generally</span></p>
<p class="font4">Theories of the localization of complex psychological phenomena, like violence, start from the premise that the brain is&nbsp;made up of specialized modules with distinct functions. Yet, the&nbsp;localization of even very basic brain functions is not as precise as&nbsp;generally is depicted in literature advocating for the localizable&nbsp;nature of violence. Even sensory and motor components of the brain&nbsp;are not neatly divided by function; this calls into question the&nbsp;soundness of hypothesizing that violence is discretely localized.</p>
<p class="font4">The brain is clearly not an undifferentiated mass: it is composed of various regions, which are visibly different both in their gross&nbsp;anatomy and cell structure (cytoarchitecture).<a name="footnote174"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark179">174</a></sup><sup></sup> Sensory and motor&nbsp;functions, in particular, occupy relatively specialized regions of the&nbsp;brain.<a name="footnote175"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark180">175</a></sup><sup></sup> Some functional differences among these different regions&nbsp;are well-established: the brain stem regulates the most basic&nbsp;functions of the body’s survival, such as breathing; the motor cortex,&nbsp;as the name implies, relates to motion and locomotion; specific parts&nbsp;of the brain also are involved in processing and interpreting sensory&nbsp;input such as visual images, smell, and sound. Some areas involved&nbsp;in uniquely human faculties, like speech, also have been identified:&nbsp;Broca and Wernicke’s regions, for example, play important&nbsp;(although not exclusive) roles in producing speech, and lesions in&nbsp;these areas can cause different kinds of aphasias.<a name="footnote176"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark181">176</a></sup><sup></sup> Neuroscientists&nbsp;consider these sensory and motor functions to be the most easily&nbsp;localized to particular regions of the brain.</p>
<p class="font4">However, even for these “simple” brain functions, many parts of the brain are involved—and it is not yet known what their&nbsp;contributions are or how they relate to each other. Indeed, it&nbsp;appears that no one part of the brain is sufficient, in isolation, to&nbsp;accomplish any function of a living being.<a name="footnote177"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark182">177</a></sup><sup></sup> Furthermore,&nbsp;individual variation in brain structure is enormous—particularly&nbsp;among human beings—meaning that the locations in the brain that&nbsp;are involved in one process in one person will not be identical in&nbsp;another person.</p>
<p class="font4">Three beautiful and careful examples of neuroscience research on sensory and motor systems—specifically, the auditory, visual,&nbsp;and motor systems—illustrate the difficulties with localizing even&nbsp;these more basic brain functions.</p>
<p class="font4">Processing sound, a basic sensory operation, involves several, known regions of the brain. Yet, putting those components together&nbsp;into “hearing” is not localized in any one part of the brain or even in&nbsp;one general region. If a person is surprised by the sound of a&nbsp;whistle, fMRI imaging shows that twenty-four distinct areas in the&nbsp;brain become active.<a name="footnote178"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark183">178</a></sup><sup></sup> Prior to imaging studies, neuroscientists&nbsp;would have assumed that many of these areas were not implicated&nbsp;in sound processing at all.<a name="footnote179"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark184">179</a></sup><sup></sup> Some of the regions may be associated&nbsp;with surprise, sound-identification, and memory. (What does a&nbsp;whistle mean to me?) Thus, a brain scan showing these twenty-four&nbsp;areas lit up would not translate directly to any specific conclusion.&nbsp;No conclusion can be drawn from such a scan about the necessity or&nbsp;sufficiency of any of these regions to processing sound generally or&nbsp;to the identification of a whistle specifically. Nor would it be&nbsp;possible to read backward from the scan either that the person&nbsp;heard a whistle or what a whistle noise means to him or her. That&nbsp;multiple sites are activated in response to a simple auditory task&nbsp;suggests that scientists and legal scholars “cannot assume that a&nbsp;brain site is necessary for a psychological process just because it was&nbsp;active during the process.”<a name="footnote180"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark185">180</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">This issue with sound processing represents the more general problem of “necessary but not sufficient.” Although “it is clearly&nbsp;true that we can say of particular brain regions that they are&nbsp;<span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span><span class="font4"> for given behaviors (or their expression),” decades of&nbsp;experiments show that “there is no region of the human brain&nbsp;[including the amygdala or pfc] of which we can say that it is&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sufficient</span><span class="font4"> for such functions.”<a name="footnote181"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark186">181</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font4">The visual system presents greater complexity and demonstrates a distinct problem. Neuroscientists working on how&nbsp;the brain processes visual stimuli to create “seeing” have made&nbsp;tremendous progress. Going back to the early 1990s, neuroscientists&nbsp;have been able to discern and describe a series of feedback and feedforward systems between brain “modules” that contribute to the&nbsp;overall gestalt of “seeing.”<a name="footnote182"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark187">182</a></sup><sup></sup> These “modules” have been organized&nbsp;by researchers into a hierarchical model that purports to show the&nbsp;contributions that each one makes to seeing.<a name="footnote183"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark188">183</a></sup><sup></sup> And yet even here,&nbsp;there may not be the degree of functional localization previously&nbsp;assumed.</p>
<p class="font4">Because of the “basic properties of interconnected networks,” it appears likely that “complex systems like [the visual system] cannot&nbsp;be organized into a unique hierarchical organizational chart.”<a name="footnote184"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark189">184</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>According to systems biologists, who work on the mathematics of&nbsp;complex, nonlinear systems, there is “an <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in principle</span><span class="font4"> barrier to the&nbsp;specification of a network hierarchy” like the brain processes that&nbsp;interrelate to create “seeing,” “no </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">matter how many experiments may&nbsp;be carried out. ”<a name="footnote185"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark190">185</a></sup><sup></sup> </span><span class="font4">While scans of auditory activity raise the&nbsp;necessary/sufficient/incidental problem, the current understanding&nbsp;of the visual system raises the issue that, in a complex networked&nbsp;system, it may be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">formally</span><span class="font4"> (that is, mathematically) impossible to&nbsp;determine the independent contributions of different components.</span></p>
<p class="font4">Work in the motor system highlights a third challenge to localization individuality; the unique make-up of every person.&nbsp;Cutting-edge experiments in neurorobotics (brain-robot interfaces)&nbsp;demonstrate that brains are unique in important ways, even as to&nbsp;simple motor functions, like moving one’s arm. MacArthur-prize&nbsp;winning neuroroboticist, Yoky Matsuoka, is showing that the motor&nbsp;neurons of every person’s brain are organized with important&nbsp;differences that defy precise localization.<a name="footnote186"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark191">186</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Professor Matsuoka’s work focuses on designing cybernetic limbs that an amputee can control through thinking about moving&nbsp;the missing limb.<a name="footnote187"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark192">187</a></sup><sup></sup> To do this, she introduces electrodes into the&nbsp;specific neurons in the subject’s brain responsible for activating arm&nbsp;movement.<a name="footnote188"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark193">188</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote189"></a><a href="#bookmark194">189</a></sup> This research would sound as if it supports the&nbsp;localization notion, at least for motor functions. And yet, this is not&nbsp;the case. She explains:</p>
<p class="font4">A person’s history determines which neurons control the arm. Even in identical twins, the same neuron in one person&nbsp;could activate the arm, but in the other twin, it could activate&nbsp;the leg. It depends on what the person has touched, seen,&nbsp;done, at critical points in his or her development.</p>
<p class="font4">For this reason, it is not possible to identify a general “arm movement location.”<a name="footnote190"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark195">190</a></sup><sup></sup> This is not surprising, because “if our brains&nbsp;were not individual, we could not be individuals.”<a name="footnote191"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark196">191</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">These problems of localizing sensory-motor functions proliferate as we move to the localization of cognitive functions. Sensory and&nbsp;motor aspects of brain function are anchored to dimensions of time,&nbsp;space, quality (e.g., hot, cold, wet), and intensity; the “further we&nbsp;move from the sensory aspects of cognition . . . the more difficult it&nbsp;becomes to find particular brain regions exclusively and uniquely&nbsp;associated with a particular cognitive process.”<a name="footnote192"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark197">192</a></sup><sup></sup> Neuroscientists&nbsp;active in localization research concerning higher cognitive functions&nbsp;confront the following problems:</p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1. Challenges Posed by Claims About PFC and Amygdalar&nbsp;Function</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">Legal scholarship advocating for a primarily brain-based understanding of violence hangs substantially on claims about the&nbsp;pfc and the amygdala. Yet, different neuroscientists have come to&nbsp;widely disparate conclusions about the functions of the pfc and the&nbsp;amygdala, implicating them in diverse mental processes unrelated&nbsp;to violence. This lack of consensus should give legal scholars pause&nbsp;before adopting a view about the localization of violence to these&nbsp;parts of the brain.</p>
<p class="font4">Looking at research on the pfc first: the prefrontal cortex is without doubt one of the most intricate and sophisticated parts of&nbsp;the brain. Indeed, there is hardly a higher-level cognitive process&nbsp;that one researcher or another has not localized to the frontal lobes.&nbsp;These include, among others:</p>

<p class="font4">• “free won’t.”<a name="footnote204"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark209">204</a></sup><sup></sup></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">This list of functions, which is itself extremely broad, only shows the tip of the proverbial iceberg: a literature review by several&nbsp;neuroscientists of the functions imputed to the pfc produced a seven-page list of different attributions.<a name="footnote205"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark210">205</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">The pfc may be involved in all of these activities, and others yet to be determined. If so, what would decreased activation of a&nbsp;person’s pfc in a particular situation tell us? The answer is: nothing&nbsp;unambiguously related to the disinhibition of violent conduct. Since&nbsp;activity in the pfc could be related to some, all, or none of the&nbsp;functions above, pfc activity cannot translate directly into impulse&nbsp;control; lower activation does not mean that a person will act on a&nbsp;violent urge, and higher activation does not mean that a person will&nbsp;not act on a violent urge.</p>
<p class="font4">Similarly, numerous respected brain researchers question the localization of fear to the amygdala,<a name="footnote206"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark211">206</a></sup><sup></sup> and the leap from fearfulness&nbsp;to violence, because “the amygdala can be activated by many events&nbsp;that have no relation to fear.”<a name="footnote207"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark212">207</a></sup><sup></sup> Pictures of food, the face of an old&nbsp;friend, and couples hugging or kissing, among other images, provoke&nbsp;amygdalar activity as long as the images are unexpected.<a name="footnote208"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark213">208</a></sup><sup></sup> If a&nbsp;subject thinks he is in an experiment to identify playing cards, and&nbsp;the researcher “shows you a picture of scrambled eggs, your&nbsp;amygdala will light up.”<a name="footnote209"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark214">209</a></sup><sup></sup> This is not because the subject is afraid&nbsp;of or angry about scrambled eggs, but just because the picture is&nbsp;unexpected.<a name="footnote210"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark215">210</a></sup><sup></sup> This group of researchers believes that “the&nbsp;amygdala gets involved when there’s news.”<a name="footnote211"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark216">211</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Other prominent contemporary researchers, like Elizabeth Phelps, depict the amygdala’s role as mediating between emotion&nbsp;and cognition,<a name="footnote212"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark217">212</a></sup><sup></sup> and providing a basis for interpreting social&nbsp;information.<a name="footnote213"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark218">213</a></sup><sup></sup> Still another view is that the amygdala plays a role&nbsp;in visual memory.<a name="footnote214"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark219">214</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">The functions of the amygdala could be (and are) the subject of numerous books and scholarly articles. The purpose of this brief&nbsp;discussion is to show the unreliability of claims that draw a linear&nbsp;relationship between amygdalar activity and criminal violence.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2. Challenges in Correlating Scan Data and Subjective&nbsp;Experience</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">A final challenge to the relationship between amygdalar or pfc activation and propensity to violence is that substantial&nbsp;discrepancies can exist between activation patterns in an fMRI and&nbsp;what people subjectively self-report about their emotional state.&nbsp;This raises the important question of what to believe—what a scan&nbsp;indicates is going on in a person’s head or what the person claims to&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p class="font4">Interestingly, some studies find “little or no relation between verbal reports of the intensity of anxiety or fear to pictures of angry&nbsp;or fearful facial expressions and the amount of activity in the&nbsp;amygdala.”<a name="footnote215"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark220">215</a></sup><sup></sup> The same is true when we move from fear or violence&nbsp;to sex: measures of women’s physiological response to pornography&nbsp;and their self-reported experience of arousal (or, more typically, lack&nbsp;thereof) correlate poorly.<a name="footnote216"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark221">216</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">The divergence between brain scan data and reported subjective experience raises an important question about detecting and&nbsp;regulating criminal violence. We might credit a woman’s self-report&nbsp;that she does not feel turned on by pornography even if biological&nbsp;indicators show activity consistent with arousal—whether because&nbsp;we believe she has no incentive to deceive or because it accords with&nbsp;cultural expectations. But what about differences in self-reporting&nbsp;versus scanning in an offender who is up for parole review? Would&nbsp;we credit his claims not to have violent impulses, even though a&nbsp;brain scan indicates reduced activation in the pfc or greater&nbsp;activation in the limbic system relative to standard ranges?</p>
<p class="font4">This is a question with serious implications for some of the proposed uses of fMRI data in criminal adjudications: how,&nbsp;generally, could we assess a discrepancy between an fMRI and selfreported mental state, in light of the fact that there can be authentic&nbsp;discrepancies between feelings and scans, and that both the subject&nbsp;and the interpreter might be influenced by incentives and biases?&nbsp;Given the tendency to credit as objective any data that appears in&nbsp;the form of a picture and that is proffered by socially-respected&nbsp;sources,<a name="footnote217"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark222">217</a></sup><sup></sup> we well might privilege scans over self-reports—and be&nbsp;mistaken in doing so.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3. Challenges of Extrapolating from Animal Models</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">While researchers have implicated the pfc and amygdala in a huge range of functions distinct from violence, the researchers who&nbsp;advocate for a close violence-amygdala/pfc connection often show&nbsp;empirical support for their claims through animal studies. These&nbsp;animal studies provide what appear to be direct and compelling&nbsp;evidence of the role of the amygdala, in particular, in causing&nbsp;violence. The raging bull and the wild monkeys reduced to&nbsp;tameness through interference with their limbic systems—did they&nbsp;not show an amazing absence of aggression?</p>
<p class="font4">In fact not. After initial reports that destruction of the amygdala could render “wild” and “aggressive” animals “tame,”&nbsp;further experiments showed that the animals likely were suffering&nbsp;from a disruption to their visual memory. So, it was not the case&nbsp;that the animals were without fear, but that they failed to recognize&nbsp;what they were looking at.<a name="footnote218"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark223">218</a></sup><sup></sup> Thus, their normal fearful or&nbsp;aggressive reaction disappeared because of interference with&nbsp;contextual thinking, not because the amygdala is the storehouse of&nbsp;fearful or aggressive impulses. Indeed, these animals still acted&nbsp;with equal “aggressiveness” to threatening physical stimuli, like&nbsp;being prodded.<a name="footnote219"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark224">219</a></sup><sup></sup> Their “violent” responses to unpleasant touch but&nbsp;apparent tameness toward everything else makes perfect sense as&nbsp;an unintended consequence of disruption to visual memory: if you do&nbsp;not know what a snake is, you might pick it up and be curious about&nbsp;it. But if it bit you, you’d still throw it down—a “violent” reaction.</p>
<p class="font4">Beyond problems with experimental design that could permit conflation of loss of visual recognition or partial paralysis with loss&nbsp;of aggression, the use of animal models in studying human violence,&nbsp;although productive and important, presents certain problems. As&nbsp;discussed in Section III.B, most research on the relationship&nbsp;between the amygdala and animal aggression has been conducted&nbsp;on cats and rats. These experimental animals are cheap, easily&nbsp;available, and share some important basic biology with people.&nbsp;While researchers frequently extrapolate from animal models to&nbsp;human models, brain and behavior are areas where particular care&nbsp;must be taken with transphyletic extrapolation.<a name="footnote220"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark225">220</a></sup><sup></sup> It is worth&nbsp;remarking on two features cats and rats share, and that humans do&nbsp;not. First, cats and rats are territorial. Second, and also unlike&nbsp;humans, they normally attack mice. Cats and rats have evolved&nbsp;brain systems that enable them to be territorial and to attack&nbsp;certain prey; the amygdala may play some role in these stereotypical&nbsp;cat and rat behaviors that it does not play in the human being.<a name="footnote221"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark226">221</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Evolution is conservative—that is, it does not proliferate new structures for new purposes but generally recruits existing&nbsp;structures to new purposes.<a name="footnote222"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark227">222</a></sup><sup></sup> In mammalian species, much brain&nbsp;anatomy is the same and yet the functions facilitated by the same&nbsp;brain structures differ between different genuses. This has been&nbsp;shown to be true of the amygdala. Lesions to the amygdala disrupt&nbsp;social communication in some primates, but not in humans.<a name="footnote223"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark228">223</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Conversely, lesions near certain language processing areas cause&nbsp;people to have serious social deficits, but, in other primates, “social&nbsp;communication... is unaffected.”<a name="footnote224"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark229">224</a></sup><sup></sup> If such differences in&nbsp;amygdalar function exist between people and our closest primate&nbsp;relatives, it is reasonable to ask whether the differences might not&nbsp;be even greater between people and cats or rats.</p>
<p class="font4">Extrapolating freely from these experiments, though, in which cats and rats are quicker to attack an intruder if their amygdalae&nbsp;are stimulated and slower or indifferent if their amygdalae are&nbsp;excised, researchers claim that the amygdala plays an important&nbsp;role in human “defensive rage.” They hypothesize that a person who&nbsp;is often violent—who, for example, commits frequent acts of road&nbsp;rage or domestic violence—has an overactive amygdala that&nbsp;interprets innocuous stimuli as provocative insults. This kind of&nbsp;excessively violent reaction, hypothesized to spring from amygdalar&nbsp;overactivation, is then (rather circularly) claimed to show that&nbsp;violence is a type of brain pathology.</p>
<p class="font4">The problems that can flow from very ambitious extrapolations from animal models are evident in the connection of normal&nbsp;aggression in cats with terrorism by people.<a name="footnote225"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark230">225</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote226"></a><a href="#bookmark231">226</a></sup> From the literature&nbsp;on “defensive rage” and “predatory aggression” in cats and rats,&nbsp;some researchers have asserted (as noted in Part II.B) that unique&nbsp;“neural topographies” might underlie specific human crimes—&nbsp;including whether a person becomes a “political terrorist.”<sup>226</sup> Even&nbsp;holding aside the problems of cross-species extrapolation, the&nbsp;related problem of meaning is obvious: terrorism is an inherently&nbsp;political concept that has a plethora of definitions and no&nbsp;independent biological reality.<a name="footnote227"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark232">227</a></sup><sup></sup> There simply is no way to&nbsp;extrapolate from activation patterns in animal brains to conclusions&nbsp;about (putative) biological bases of human terrorism—much less&nbsp;legal prescriptions for intervention in the same.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4. Issues with Extrapolation from Human Brain Injury Cases</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">If claims about the localization of violence based on animal experiments are suspect, what about evidence directly from human&nbsp;beings? Accidental brain injuries and brain diseases have produced&nbsp;a host of illuminating scientific curiosities that sometimes have led&nbsp;to medical breakthroughs.<a name="footnote228"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark233">228</a></sup><sup></sup> But the Gage and Whitman stories are&nbsp;canards that contribute very little to understanding criminal&nbsp;violence. Although brain injuries can be catastrophic, there is no&nbsp;reliable relationship between pfc damage and violent or impulsive&nbsp;behavior. While in some cases “relatively large volumes of brain can&nbsp;be ‘disconnected’ without much obvious consequence,” in other cases&nbsp;extremely small traumas of a few millimeters can “have devastating&nbsp;effects.”<a name="footnote229"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark234">229</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote230"></a><a href="#bookmark235">230</a></sup> Brain injury continues to puzzle, and throws more&nbsp;caution than light on simplistic localization arguments about the&nbsp;functioning of intact brains.<a name="footnote231"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark236">231</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">For these reasons, it is “surprising[ ]” that “a few scientists” have started to use pfc activity levels “as a referent for moral feeling&nbsp;or judgment.”<a name="footnote232"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark237">232</a></sup><sup></sup> While it is true that certain “[pjsychopaths who are&nbsp;shown an aggressive picture . . . display less activation” in the pfc&nbsp;than neurotypical people, the reverse is not true: “most adults with&nbsp;damage to, or compromise of, the orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex&nbsp;never commit a serious crime, whereas most who lie, cheat, and&nbsp;steal have perfectly intact brains.”<a name="footnote233"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark238">233</a></sup><sup></sup> This is not to say that brain&nbsp;trauma or disease could not produce dramatic personality changes;&nbsp;it could. The questions of how the brain reroutes around and&nbsp;compensates for injuries, and how it continues to change throughout&nbsp;a person’s life, form a whole field of inquiry in their own right. The&nbsp;limited point here is just that isolated stories like those of Gage and&nbsp;Whitman may have less to say than is claimed about them or than&nbsp;at first it may appear.</p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">C. Violence as a Legal Term and Psychological Construct</span></p>
<p class="font4">In order for violence to be localizable to activity in specific parts of the brain, or to particular brain dysfunctions, it must designate a&nbsp;coherent or homogenous thing. “Violence,” however, designates a&nbsp;huge range of individual, group, and even national behavior.<a name="footnote234"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark239">234</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>What the law recognizes as violence changes greatly over time and&nbsp;place. Violence takes its meaning from the law, social norms, and&nbsp;the particular context in which the violent acts take place.<a name="footnote235"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark240">235</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Two relatively recent changes in the criminal law illustrate the legally-contingent nature of what a society calls “violence”: the&nbsp;creation of the category of domestic violence and the proscription of&nbsp;one kind of sexual violence through the elimination of the marital&nbsp;rape exception. Prior to the latter quarter of the twentieth century,&nbsp;victims of abuse by intimates might have identified their abusers’&nbsp;conduct as violent—but legal culture did not. Until Pennsylvania&nbsp;passed its landmark Protection from Abuse Act in 1977, domestic&nbsp;violence was largely unrecognized and not separately legally&nbsp;actionable.<a name="footnote236"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark241">236</a></sup><sup></sup> With the stroke of a legislator’s pen, acts that&nbsp;previously did not rate the designation “criminal violence” suddenly&nbsp;became legally defined as such.</p>
<p class="font4">The marital rape exception tells the same story as to sexual violence in the home. Until relatively recently, state courts across&nbsp;the United States presumed that a husband had a right to sex at&nbsp;any time within marriage, regardless of the wife’s actual consent.<a name="footnote237"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark242">237</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>After much legal and social contestation, this aspect of what&nbsp;previously was a conjugal right became redefined as marital rape; a&nbsp;husband who was exercising his legally-sanctioned rights one day&nbsp;became the perpetrator of criminal sexual violence the next. This&nbsp;was a change in the law, not a change in perpetrators’ brains.<a name="footnote238"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark243">238</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Today, in much of Asia and the Middle East, the marital rape&nbsp;exception endures;<a name="footnote239"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark244">239</a></sup><sup></sup> thus, the same conduct that is “criminal&nbsp;violence” in one culture is not considered “violence” at all under the&nbsp;laws and mores of another. This small example illustrates that&nbsp;what counts as violence depends substantially on who gets to define&nbsp;it.</p>
<p class="font4">As discussed above, social unrest incident to the struggle for civil rights was a major impetus in the 1960s for calls for widespread lobotomy. Drs. Sweet, Mark, and Ervin explicitly linked&nbsp;their localization theory of violence to neurobiological differences in&nbsp;race rioters: because some African-Americans rioted and others did&nbsp;not, they reasoned, the only explanation for this distinction must lie&nbsp;outside the slum conditions in which both rioters and nonrioters&nbsp;lived. Rather, there must be a “brain proneness to violence”&nbsp;amongst those who rioted.<a name="footnote240"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark245">240</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Surely, the acts of rioters count as “violence” under any customary definition. However, Drs. Mark and Ervin notably failed&nbsp;to consider that mass injustices perpetrated by whites against&nbsp;African-Americans also might constitute “violence.” No&nbsp;contemporary proposals were advanced to, for example, conduct&nbsp;neurobiological studies of white supremacist gangs or enthusiastic&nbsp;Southern sheriffs to determine the brain disorders underlying <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">their&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">predispositions to violence. Nor were any proposals for “therapeutic&nbsp;lobotomy” or “sedative neurosurgery” advanced for dealing with the&nbsp;then-widespread problem of white violence. Thus, while the laws at&nbsp;the time proscribed both rioting and the acts of individual violence&nbsp;by whites against blacks, only the conduct of one group appeared&nbsp;problematic; thus we see that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">who</span><span class="font4"> is described as violent, as well as&nbsp;what is described as violence, also depends on who is making the&nbsp;judgments.</span></p>
<p class="font4">Moving outside of legal definitions, violence may be understood better as a psychological construct than as a biological fact.<a name="footnote241"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark246">241</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Psychological constructs describe general features observed across&nbsp;people, like “intelligence” or “memory,”<a name="footnote242"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark247">242</a></sup><sup></sup> that are united by&nbsp;functional similarities, or family resemblances, more than by a&nbsp;common biology.<a name="footnote243"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark248">243</a></sup><sup></sup> Psychologists do not consider these to be real&nbsp;“things” that can be measured in the same way as, for example,&nbsp;height, although they can be measured functionally.<a name="footnote244"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark249">244</a></sup><sup></sup> Psychological&nbsp;constructs may be valuable, and may map well onto behavior; yet, it&nbsp;is well recognized that they may have no relationship to a particular&nbsp;underlying biology at all.<a name="footnote245"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark250">245</a></sup><sup></sup></p>

<p class="font4">IV. <span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Norms and Neurons: Toward Integrating Brain-Level and&nbsp;Social-Level Approaches in Criminal Law</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">At the start of this Article, I argued that similar beliefs have been at work in each of the past major criminal law and&nbsp;neuroscience movements and inform some of the current work that&nbsp;identifies the commission of violent offenses as emerging from brainbased pathology. This Part will unite past and current movements&nbsp;by exploring their common themes. It will then offer examples of&nbsp;how neuroscience could contribute to legal understandings of the&nbsp;causes of violent acts; these examples suggest an approach to&nbsp;incorporating neuroscience into criminal law that is less ambitious&nbsp;than a total brain-based theory of violence—but that may, for that&nbsp;very reason, prove more productive. Scholars like Elizabeth Phelps&nbsp;and Dame Susan Greenfield (among many others) examine the ways&nbsp;that beliefs and identities are formed on a neurological level; how&nbsp;people differentiate in-groups and out-groups; and how people use&nbsp;different kinds of emotions, like disgust, in making judgments about&nbsp;others. This work could inform approaches to the design of legal&nbsp;institutions to enhance prosocial behavior and reduce violent&nbsp;conflict, but it would not promise to provide clear answers “in the&nbsp;brain” for why violence happens.</p>

<p class="font4">Understanding criminal violence primarily as brain-based rests on the notion that personal, social, and cultural phenomena—from&nbsp;an individual’s actions to the way markets function—not only can be&nbsp;explained, but are caused and determined, by the make-up of the&nbsp;most basic physical components of a system. This is reductive&nbsp;materialism,<a name="footnote246"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark251">246</a></sup><sup></sup> a way of thinking that aims to explain higher-level&nbsp;phenomena completely in terms of their lower-level components; it&nbsp;entails the belief that higher-level phenomena also are completely&nbsp;caused by lower-level phenomena.<a name="footnote247"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark252">247</a></sup><sup></sup> Thus, according to a reductive&nbsp;materialist view of the brain (“neuropsychological reductionism” or&nbsp;neuroreductionism<a name="footnote248"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark253">248</a></sup><sup></sup>), all “human thought and behavior” is best&nbsp;understood by examining “physical processes taking place inside the&nbsp;brain . . . ,”<a name="footnote249"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark254">249</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote250"></a><a href="#bookmark255">250</a></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Describing this school of thought, Professor Owen Jones writes:</p>
<p class="font4">[A]ll choices emerge from the human nervous system. . . . The [nervous] system is composed of molecules, in turn composed&nbsp;of atoms, and it is driven by chemical reactions and electrical&nbsp;circuits. The nervous system and its brain are therefore part&nbsp;of a material world in which present events are caused by&nbsp;prior events, <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">extending back to the beginning of time and&nbsp;matter.</span></p>
<p class="font4">Those who subscribe to the strong reductionist position believe (or would agree) that the Big Bang contained within it all the&nbsp;information that has determined everything that has come after—&nbsp;that “the entire history of the stars [and] . . . the history of life as&nbsp;well” was “immanent in that millionth of a second when the&nbsp;universe began,”<a name="footnote251"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark256">251</a></sup><sup></sup> including, among other things (or among&nbsp;everything) the emergence of life on earth, the evolution of human&nbsp;kind, and whether a particular person would commit a violent&nbsp;criminal offense. This is because “all choices emerge” from an&nbsp;unbroken chain of causation stretching back to “the beginning of&nbsp;time.”<a name="footnote252"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark257">252</a></sup><sup></sup> Translating this view to the relationship between brain,&nbsp;behavior, and society to understanding criminal violence leads to an&nbsp;individualistic approach in which the individual brain or even&nbsp;subregions of the brain are taken as the basic unit of analysis.<a name="footnote253"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark258">253</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Viewing criminality as the result of brain dysfunction—of biological difference between lawbreakers and nonlawbreakers—&nbsp;dovetails with the concept of alterity. “Alterity” is the construction&nbsp;of community through the identification and exclusion of the&nbsp;“Other.”<a name="footnote254"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark259">254</a></sup><sup></sup> Criminal law, a strongly normative discipline, is&nbsp;understood to reinforce community ideals by defining and excluding&nbsp;that which threatens the community, whether the threat is&nbsp;practical, normative, or both;<a name="footnote255"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark260">255</a></sup><sup></sup> thus alterity is a significant concept&nbsp;within criminal law. The relationship between criminal law and&nbsp;alterity is at best an ambivalent one, however, because it is an&nbsp;aspiration (and perhaps a conceit) of liberalism that we judge the act&nbsp;and not the actor.<a name="footnote256"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark261">256</a></sup><sup></sup> Accordingly, the normative criminal law in the&nbsp;liberal state is both prone to alterity and on its guard against it.&nbsp;The idea of the biological “Other,” the “born criminal,” satisfies the&nbsp;urge to alterize the criminal but also raises questions about the&nbsp;propriety—and relevance—of doing so in a system that at least aims&nbsp;to judge acts and not statuses.</p>
<p class="font4">Neuroscience approaches to legal issues can (but need not) feed into the concept of alterity in criminal law by defining people who&nbsp;commit crimes as biologically different. Alterity in past and current&nbsp;claims about violent offenders is not subtle. For Cesare Lombroso,&nbsp;the brain of the criminal resembled that of the “rat” or the “lower&nbsp;carnivore.”<a name="footnote257"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark262">257</a></sup><sup></sup> Psychointerventionalists of the mid-twentieth century&nbsp;compared violence in people to the behaviors of the “raging bull” or&nbsp;the “predatory and vicious lynx” and “wolverine.”<sup>266</sup> The racial&nbsp;dimension present in past episodes also speaks to the notion of the&nbsp;violent person as the biological “Other.” As discussed above, Drs.&nbsp;Mark, Ervin, and Sweet explicitly linked their localization theory of&nbsp;violence—and their recommendation of mass lobotomy—to putative&nbsp;neurobiological differences in race rioters. The absence of any&nbsp;consideration of the neurobiology of white violence toward African-Americans suggests that they <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante</span><span class="font4"> viewed their subjects (however&nbsp;subconsciously) as Other.</span></p>
<p class="font4">The express and implied racism of earlier criminal law-brain science movements emphatically is not present in current work in&nbsp;the field. Scholars are extremely careful to distinguish their work&nbsp;from the race-based premises and applications of brain sciences in&nbsp;criminal law in past eras.<a name="footnote258"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark263">258</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote259"></a><a href="#bookmark264">259</a></sup> Furthermore, none of the current work&nbsp;focuses on racial difference, nor have any scholars differentially&nbsp;focused on any racial groups. Absent the racial dimension, however,&nbsp;alterity remains implicit in current claims that locate criminal&nbsp;violence in brain difference. If behavior is determined by brain&nbsp;structure and function (holding aside for the moment the causes and&nbsp;fixity of such difference), and a person behaves in ways that deviate&nbsp;from the norm, then that difference must be biological difference;&nbsp;this makes the offender the “Other.”</p>
<p class="font4">In constructing violence as a biological feature of violent offenders, historical and some modern localization stories offer a&nbsp;comforting answer to the problem of evil: there are no evil people,&nbsp;just dysfunctional brains. One of the most common reactions to&nbsp;horrific acts of violence is to ask how a person (or people) could do&nbsp;such a thing. Extreme acts of violence are, most of the time and to&nbsp;most people, incomprehensible. Such acts pose hard questions.&nbsp;Perhaps the only easy or comforting answer is that such acts are the&nbsp;product of real, literal sickness: “Crime is . . . pathological”;<a name="footnote260"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark265">260</a></sup><sup></sup> “Crime&nbsp;[is] a disease.”<a name="footnote261"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark266">261</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">B. Turning the Premises Around: Toward Integrating Norms and Neurons</span></p>
<p class="font4">The criminal law’s resurgent attention to neuroscience offers an opportunity for collaboration that does not recapitulate past&nbsp;problems rooted in determinism and alterity. While accepting that&nbsp;all behavior is produced by the brain,<a name="footnote262"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark267">262</a></sup><sup></sup> work of the kind discussed&nbsp;here explores how the criminal law could use this knowledge at&nbsp;levels ranging from the individual to the general, and to clarify the&nbsp;contributions of both pathology and normalcy to the commission of&nbsp;violent offenses. Two areas of inquiry, below, on intragroupintergroup biases and on the role of emotions in decision-making,&nbsp;suggest that neuroscience research can help illuminate the presence&nbsp;of basic neural systems that become socially shaped; this suggests&nbsp;that the law may not be able to eradicate the sometimes dangerous&nbsp;predispositions that arise from these systems but could leverage&nbsp;them in more useful ways. This section closes with some suggested&nbsp;avenues for future research.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1. In-Groups and Out-Groups, Identity, and Violence</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">“Can we all get along?”<a name="footnote263"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark268">263</a></sup><sup></sup> Rodney King uttered this famous plea when riots rocked Los Angeles after an all-white jury acquitted&nbsp;police officers of severely beating Mr. King. Mr. King’s question is a&nbsp;perennial one, as is the problem of intergroup violence and&nbsp;subjugation. Recent cognitive neuroscience studies suggest that&nbsp;people are primed to make self-other distinctions<a name="footnote264"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark269">264</a></sup><sup></sup>—but that who&nbsp;we see as “self’ and who we see as “other” are strongly socially&nbsp;influenced<a name="footnote265"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark270">265</a></sup><sup></sup> as well as subject to change through experience and&nbsp;learning.<a name="footnote266"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark271">266</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Because much violence involves intergroup conflict, as well as conflict between individuals of perceived different groups, scholars&nbsp;in criminal law may look to the developing neurobiological literature&nbsp;on intragroup-intergroup identification, belief, and identity to&nbsp;reduce destructive group bias and conflict.<a name="footnote267"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark272">267</a></sup><sup></sup> It is unlikely that&nbsp;there are distinct brain-based predispositions or pathologies&nbsp;subserving all the violent offenses from hate crimes to gang behavior&nbsp;to terrorism to ethnic and political violence; yet, self-other and&nbsp;intragroup-intergroup distinctions may play some role in all of&nbsp;them. Functional imaging studies show that fear conditioning is&nbsp;easier to establish and harder to erase relative to members of the&nbsp;“other” group than to one’s own group: subjects in the lab learn&nbsp;positive associations faster and negative associations more slowly as&nbsp;to members of their own groups; conversely, negative views of the&nbsp;members of the “other” group persist much longer than toward&nbsp;members of one’s own group, even in light of contrary information.<a name="footnote268"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark273">268</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">This work on the difference between us-them perception raises the question of how these beliefs come to be incorporated physically&nbsp;by the subject<a name="footnote269"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark274">269</a></sup><sup></sup>—and how these kinds of beliefs may relate to acts of&nbsp;violence. Examining how beliefs come to be laid down in the brain,&nbsp;researchers are finding that ideas with a belief-based component are&nbsp;both easier to remember and harder to overcome than ideas&nbsp;communicated through fact or logic.<a name="footnote270"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark275">270</a></sup><sup></sup> Everyone has experienced&nbsp;that strong emotion (“high arousal”) makes a much stronger mark in&nbsp;one’s mind than dry facts; this metaphorical sense appears to be&nbsp;literally true in fMRI studies of belief and memory formation.<a name="footnote271"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark276">271</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>One’s basic beliefs appear to become encoded into the brain through&nbsp;a combination of high-arousal experiences and through repetition.<a name="footnote272"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark277">272</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Institutionalized religious practices incorporate both of these&nbsp;features, with emotional stories and ceremonies (high arousal), and&nbsp;prayers, memorization of texts or creeds, and chanting (high&nbsp;repetition).</p>
<p class="font4">There may be a relationship, Dame Susan Greenfield speculates, between the degree of individualism of a person’s&nbsp;identity and the degree of autonomic arousal and aversion the&nbsp;person will feel in response to threats or risks to self.<a name="footnote273"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark278">273</a></sup><sup></sup> A person&nbsp;with a more collective identity may perceive threats or insults to the&nbsp;group more like a threat to the self; conversely, he or she may&nbsp;perceive a risk to the self that does not implicate the group as less&nbsp;comparatively alarming or aversive.<a name="footnote274"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark279">274</a></sup><sup></sup> If religion were used to&nbsp;inculcate collective-focused beliefs, through high-arousal experiences&nbsp;and repetition, such beliefs would be difficult to dislodge through&nbsp;appeals to fact, logic, or self-interest. This work does not suggest&nbsp;that some cultural beliefs predispose any person to violence. But it&nbsp;may suggest that people from cultures that promote group&nbsp;identification will perceive threats or slights to the culture as if they&nbsp;were directed at the individual; they also may be more willing to&nbsp;take individual risks on behalf of the cultural group.<a name="footnote275"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark280">275</a></sup><sup></sup></p>
<p class="font4">Greenfield’s description of how neural processes mediate and are mediated by cultural processes may not provide an explanation&nbsp;for why some people become suicide-terrorists: not only does she&nbsp;recognize the attenuated relationship between belief and identity,&nbsp;and identity and risk perception, but also the large leap from&nbsp;reduced individual risk aversion to committing self-destructive&nbsp;violence. Furthermore, her remarks are speculative and require&nbsp;much additional investigation. But her approach offers a plausible&nbsp;account of why suicide-terrorism, or other self-destructive ways of&nbsp;perpetrating group or political violence, like the Japanese <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tokubetsu&nbsp;kögeki tai</span><span class="font4"> (kamikaze), appear more commonly in cultures that&nbsp;expressly value strong religious or national identification.</span></p>
<p class="font4">This way of relating neuroscientific findings to individual violent crimes notably does not conform to the three themes or&nbsp;tenets that have run through prior criminal law-brain science&nbsp;movements: it does not posit any putative violence-related brain&nbsp;dysfunction in the perpetrator; does not view violence as a thing&nbsp;that can be localized to a specific part of the brain; and, although it&nbsp;explores how cultural differences may relate to individual behavior,&nbsp;does not construe the perpetrator of a violent act as essentially&nbsp;different from people who do not commit such acts. Furthermore,&nbsp;under this view, it would not be possible to put an individual into a&nbsp;scanner, identify an under- or over-active brain region, and then use&nbsp;such a scan as a prediction technique of future violent conduct in the&nbsp;pre- or post-conviction setting. Rather, it construes violence of a&nbsp;specific type as the end of an array of interactions between brain,&nbsp;culture, and political context, and explores how those factors relate&nbsp;to individual responses to risk to the self; in other words, such&nbsp;studies on belief formation show how neurons and norms literally&nbsp;come together.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2. A Few More Avenues</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">There are myriad ways neuroscience could contribute to criminal law, ranging from general models of emotion and behavior&nbsp;to specific analyses of particular punishments and rehabilitation&nbsp;strategies. In such a new and developing field, it would be&nbsp;impossible (as well as an act of hubris) to try to predict all of the&nbsp;potential avenues of research. A few of these future avenues could&nbsp;include work on preventing criminal behavior, designing individual&nbsp;sentences and general penalties in a more informed manner, and&nbsp;rehabilitating offenders.</p>
<p class="font4">As a threshold matter, it could be useful to investigate the nonpathological pathways that lead to violence, like confinement&nbsp;and frustration. The existence of “air rage” and “road rage” suggest&nbsp;that there are situations or structures that predictably stress people&nbsp;beyond their capacity for self-control. If we were to better&nbsp;understand the general conditions that provoke aggression, we&nbsp;might be able to design systems that help minimize such triggers.&nbsp;This moves us from the notion of violence-as-pathology to a more&nbsp;general understanding of our capacity for violence under given&nbsp;conditions.</p>
<p class="font4">Neuroimaging could perhaps help describe what types of behaviors or beliefs that lead to violence are more readily&nbsp;changeable or malleable. When experimental psychologists teach an&nbsp;animal a conditioned response—like the expectation of a reward in&nbsp;response to a tone—and then teach the animal to “unlearn” that&nbsp;response, they call it “extinguishing” the response.<a name="footnote276"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark281">276</a></sup><sup></sup> What&nbsp;neurobiological factors make certain behaviors or beliefs easier or&nbsp;harder to “extinguish”? And how would that vary based on&nbsp;individual factors, like motivation? Conversely, there may be some&nbsp;behaviors that may be particularly resistant to change. In both&nbsp;cases, such information might have predictive value as to recidivism&nbsp;as well as suggest which offenders would benefit most from&nbsp;rehabilitation strategies.</p>
<p class="font4">Another area may be juvenile justice. As the landmark decision in <span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roper v. Simmons<a name="footnote277"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark282">277</a></sup><sup></sup></span><span class="font4"> recently acknowledged in holding&nbsp;unconstitutional the death penalty for offenders who committed&nbsp;their offenses as juveniles,<a name="footnote278"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark283">278</a></sup><sup></sup> research shows that different parts of&nbsp;the brain mature at different ages.<a name="footnote279"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark284">279</a></sup><sup></sup> While the Court focused on the&nbsp;“diminished culpability of juveniles,”<a name="footnote280"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark285">280</a></sup><sup></sup> this research also raises the&nbsp;question of whether juveniles are more amenable to rehabilitation&nbsp;than adults. If so, that would suggest a reconsideration of the&nbsp;punitive emphasis in much of the juvenile system. Furthermore, it&nbsp;might be possible to model effects of punishment on juveniles on a&nbsp;neurological level: what are the effects on developing brains of being&nbsp;exposed to conditions of punishment, and do those differ from effects&nbsp;on adult brains?</span></p>
<p class="font4">The neurological impact of conditions of confinement could be investigated as well. It is well known observationally that extended&nbsp;solitary confinement seriously affects mental health.<a name="footnote281"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark286">281</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Hypothetically, if it could be determined that extended solitary&nbsp;confinement causes neurological changes known to be associated&nbsp;with severe stress and with certain mental illnesses, like cell death&nbsp;in the hippocampus, that might provide grounds to set limits on&nbsp;certain conditions of confinement. This would move out of research&nbsp;on the causes of violence by individuals, but would consider whether&nbsp;the state does undue violence through methods of punishment.</p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p class="font4">Albert Einstein wrote that the best models should be “as simple as possible, but no simpler.”<a name="footnote282"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark287">282</a></sup><sup></sup> The claim that the criminal law can&nbsp;understand violence principally as emerging from localized brain&nbsp;dysfunction in people who are neurobiologically distinct is simpler&nbsp;than possible. The brain is a physical manifestation of the&nbsp;interaction between biology and society; our increasing&nbsp;understanding of its plasticity and function may lead us to conclude&nbsp;that it is impossible to fix a biological nature apart from a social&nbsp;existence. A “more unified picture of brain-behavior relationships&nbsp;and [of] the nature of human problems” would integrate “the&nbsp;overlapping aspects of existence represented by the organization of&nbsp;the brain, the individual, and the society.”<a name="footnote283"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark288">283</a></sup><sup></sup> The challenge in this&nbsp;time period, in this particular episode of the affair between criminal&nbsp;law and neuroscience, is to use neuroscience not to craft attractive&nbsp;simplifications but to shed a measure of light on complex and&nbsp;multifaceted realities.</p>
